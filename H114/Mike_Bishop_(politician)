Bishop]</ref>\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\nA graduate of [[Rochester Adams High School]], Bishop graduated with honors from [[University of Michigan]] in 1989.  He then went on to earn his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Michigan State University College of Law]]. Bishop is also a licensed [[real estate broker]] and has owned two local real estate businesses, Freedom Realty, Inc. and Pro Management, Inc. Bishop is a member of the [[American Bar Association]], [[State Bar of Michigan]], [[District of Columbia Bar]], Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, Oakland County Bar Association, Michigan Association of Realtors, and [[National Association of Realtors]]. He served on the Municipal Law and Business Law committees of the Oakland County Bar Association and is a member of the National Association of Sportsmen Legislators. Following his time in the Michigan Legislature, Bishop worked as Chief Legal Officer for International Bancard Corporation and taught at [[Thomas M. Cooley Law School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mikebishop.house.gov/about|title=About|work=Congressman Mike Bishop|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Michigan legislature==\nBishop served in the Michigan State House from 1999 to 2002 representing the 45th District.  He was subsequently elected to the State Senate in 2002 representing the 12th District, a seat which was previously held by his father, Donald Bishop, and serving until 2010 when [[term limits]] prevented him from re-election.  He ran for Oakland County prosecutor in 2012, but lost to Democratic incumbent Jessica R. Cooper.\n\nBefore his time as majority leader, Bishop was chosen to be chairman of the Banking and Financial Institutions Committee and vice chairman of both the Gaming and Casino Oversight Committee and Judiciary Committee. During his four-year tenure in the Michigan House, he served as vice chairman of the Commerce Committee.\n\nWhile Mike Bishop was Senate Majority Leader a bill to create the Gordie Howe International bridge as a companion to the Ambassador bridge came to him for determination to put it to the Senate floor for a vote.  Corporate and business interests were strongly in favor of the bill which would partner with Canada to pay for the bridge.  Despite promising to put the bill on the floor for a vote Bishop reneged, according to former Michigan Governor and ambassador to Canada Jim Blanchard.  The project would create tens of thousands of jobs.  He had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Matty Maroun, the owner of the Ambassador bridge, who wanted to build the bridge himself next to the Ambassador bridge which would have certainly created massive bottlenecks.  Governor Snyder, once elected, found another way to make the deal however and the project continued without Bishop's support.<ref>Lessenbury, J. (2014, October 22).
