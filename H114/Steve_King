Congressman King avoided the draft with \"2S\" deferments in 1967, 1968 and 1969. Nine days after receiving his third deferment, President Richard Nixon signed an amendment to the Military Service Act of 1967 that created the draft lottery. Under the new lottery system, draft deferments were still allowed.  Because he had been receiving deferments under the old draft system, King was still shielded from being drafted in the lottery system as long as he maintained his deferments and stayed in school.\n\nIn the first lottery held on December 1, 1969, 366 numbers were assigned, one for each possible birth date. The birth date of May 28, Steve King\u2019s birth date, was assigned number 308. This was an extremely high number. The highest number drafted that year was, in fact, 195. Furthermore, King\u2019s draft number was assigned to him permanently. It meant that he would be protected from the draft by his high number even if he allowed his draft deferment to expire by leaving school. King did leave school when he quit Northwest Missouri State University in 1970. No reason has ever been publicly offered as to why he chose to leave Northwest Missouri State three years into his college education without earning a degree.<ref>{{citehttp://www.bleedingheartland.com/2010/10/22/king-and-the-draft/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, he founded King Construction, an earth moving company.
