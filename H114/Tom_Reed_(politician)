Congressman Tom Reed. 2013-06-03 (Retrieved 2014-02-24)</ref>\n\nOn May 22, 2014, Reed introduced the [[Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to permanently extend and expand certain expired provisions that provided an enhanced tax deduction for businesses that donated their food [[inventory]] to [[charitable organizations]].<ref name=4719sum>{{cite web|title=H.R.4719 \u2013 Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4719|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=4719cbo>{{cite web|title=CBO \u2013 H.R. 4719|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45425|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> Reed argued that it makes sense to make this a permanent measure because \"doing it on a temporary basis... is part of the problem. We need to make this sound policy permanent in the tax code and I'm optimistic we'll get it to the finish and allow people to take advantage of the tax deduction that would encourage them to use the food rather than put it in a landfill.\"<ref name=WENYreed>{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Kellie|title=Reed Fighting Hunger Incentive Act|url=http://www.weny.com/news/local-news/reed-fighting-hunger-incentive-act052714|accessdate=16 July 2014|publisher=WENY|date=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]]'''\n** [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight]]\n** [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources]]\n** [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures]]\n\n===Caucus membership===\n* [[Republican Study Committee]]\n* [[Republican Main Street Partnership]]\n* Natural Gas Caucus (Co-Chair)\n* House Manufacturing Caucus (Co-Chair)\n* Congressional Diabetes Caucus (Vice-Chair)\n* Private Property Rights Caucus (Chairman/Founder)\n\n==Personal life==\nReed married his wife, Jean, in 1996.
