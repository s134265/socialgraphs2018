The district includes many eastern and northern [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] suburbs. He is the first Republican to represent this particular district.\n\n==Early life==\nPoe was born in [[Temple, Texas|Temple]] in [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]], [[Texas]], but attended [[Spring Woods High School]] in Houston. Poe resides in [[Humble, Texas|Humble]], Texas. He graduated in 1970, with a degree in [[political science]] from [[Abilene Christian University]] in [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], Texas; he was his class president. In 1973, he graduated with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Houston Law Center]]. He participated in the school's honor society. From 1970 to 1976, he served in the [[United States Air Force]] Reserve\u2019s C-130 Unit at Houston\u2019s [[Ellington Air Force Base]].\n\n==Judicial career==\nAfter serving as a chief felony prosecutor in [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] (Houston) for eight years, Poe was appointed a felony court judge in Harris County in 1981, becoming one of the youngest judges in the state. In this position, he gained national prominence for his unusual criminal sentences that included ordering thieves to carry signs in front of stores from which they stole.<ref name=tanenbaum-slut>{{cite book|author=[[Leora Tanenbaum]]|title=Slut!: growing up female with a bad reputation|year=1999|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|isbn=0060957409|page=19|edition=1st}}</ref> However, in at least one case, Poe amended the sentence afterwards without notifying the victim's family.<ref>{{cite web|first=Sarah|last=Fenske|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2004-10-07/news/after-oprah/|title=After Oprah |publisher=HoustonPress|date=October 7, 2004|accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==Elections to United States Congress==\nIn November 2004, Poe ran for the U.S. House in the 2nd District.
