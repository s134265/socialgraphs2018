O'Rourke's own company, Stanton Street Technology Group, was providing Internet and Information Technology services to Paso del Norte.

The resolution, which was unanimously supported by his colleagues on the El Paso City Council was vetoed by then-Mayor [[John Cook (Texas politician)|John Cook]], and spurred a larger national discussion on the topic. He told reporters that the reason he decided to speak up about what he called the failed war on drugs was the thousands of people who have been killed in the drug war in the adjoining city of [[Ciudad Juarez|Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua]], Mexico. \"I hope it has all had its intended affect of starting the national discussion of the wisdom of the war on drugs \u2026 and probably more importantly,
