She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district, numbered as the 22nd District from 1998 to 2003 and the 23rd from 2003 to 2013, includes all of [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]] counties and a portion of [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].\n\nCapps serves on the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], where she is a member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Health. She is a member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]].\n\n==Background==\nCapps was born Lois Ragnhild Grimsrud in [[Ladysmith, Wisconsin]], the daughter of Solveig Magdalene (n\u00e9e Gullixson) and Rev. Jurgen Milton Grimsrud, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister. Both of her parents' families came from [[Norway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/capps.htm|title=capps|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> She has lived in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] since 1964. She was educated at [[Pacific Lutheran University]] with a bachelor's degree in [[nursing]]. She earned a master's degree in religion at [[Yale Divinity School]] in 1964<ref>[http://divinity.yale.edu/lois-capps-1964-mar Lois Capps 1964 M.A.R. 2004 Distinction in Community Service]</ref> and a master's degree in education at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].\n\nIn 1960, while at Yale, she married [[Walter Capps]], a divinity student at Yale who later became a prominent religious studies professor at UCSB; they eventually had three children. Walter died in 1997 and their eldest daughter Lisa died in 2000. Lois Capps worked for 20 years as a nurse and health advocate for the Santa Barbara public schools and also taught early childhood education part-time at [[Santa Barbara City College]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nWalter Capps was elected to Congress in 1996 in a rematch of his 1994 race against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Andrea Seastrand]]. However, he died of a heart attack on October 28, 1997, only nine months into his term. His widow won the then-[[California's 22nd congressional district|22nd District]] seat by defeating Republican [[Tom J. Bordonaro, Jr.|Tom Bordonaro]] in a [[special election]] on March 10, 1998. She was sworn into the 105th Congress on March 17. Lois Capps successfully defended her seat against Bordonaro in a general election later that year, and commenced her first full term in office. Capps is one of two sitting representatives to be elected to their seats following the deaths of their husbands, along with [[Doris Matsui]] (D-[[California|CA]]).\n\nIn 2000, Capps retained the 22nd district seat, defeating Republican Mike Stoker with 53% of the vote. She was the first Democrat to hold the district for more than one term in over 50 years (the district, known as the 11th from its formation in 1943 until 1953, the 13th from 1953 to 1975 and the 19th from 1975 to 1993, had been held by Republicans from 1947 until Walter Capps was sworn in 1997).\n\nCapps' district was renumbered as the 23rd after the 2000 census and made somewhat safer, and she was reelected without serious opposition in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. Her district was renumbered as the 24th District after the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cappsforcongress.com/news/capps-running-for-re-election-in-new-central-coast-congressional-district |title=Capps Running for Re-Election in New Central Coast Congressional District |date=July 29, 2011 |publisher=Re-Elect Lois Capps |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref> David Wasserman, House editor of ''[[The Cook Political Report]]'', predicted that this would be a more difficult race, and local Republicans confirmed that Capps was one of their top targets in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=New district maps threaten Republicans' seats in Congress |author=Jean Merl and Richard Simon |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-congress-republicans-20111212,0,3290683.story |newspaper=LA Times |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> The reconfigured district still includes Santa Barbara and [[San Luis Obispo]], but was redrawn to include most of the more Republican inland areas of Santa Barbara County.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map|title=Members of Congress & Congressional District Maps - GovTrack.us|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Capps eventually beat her opponent, [[Abel Maldonado]], with 54.8% of the vote.<ref>http://www.theadobepress.com/articles/2012/11/09/news/news55.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Capps ran against Republican [[Christopher Mitchum|Chris Mitchum]], an actor, screenwriter, and businessman.
