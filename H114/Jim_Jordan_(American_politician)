He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is located in the north-central portion of the state and includes [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], [[Tiffin, Ohio|Tiffin]], and [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]].\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nJordan was born and raised in [[Champaign County, Ohio]] and attended [[Graham High School (St. Paris, Ohio)|Graham High School]], graduating in 1982. While at Graham, he was a four-time state wrestling champion with a career record of 150\u20131.  He graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in 1986, obtaining his bachelor's degree in economics.

Before entering politics, he was an assistant wrestling coach with the Ohio State University wrestling program.\n\n==Ohio General Assembly==\nJordan was first elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio General Assembly]] in November 1994 and went on to serve three terms as State Representative of the 85th Ohio House District. In 1996, he offered an amendment to the Welfare Reform Bill that limited the amount of time that an able-bodied individual could remain on welfare. He also created the Income Tax Reduction Fund, which required that any state revenue surpluses be used to lower the income tax burden on Ohioans rather than be used for further government spending.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 2000, he won a seat in the [[Ohio Senate]] by defeating independent candidate Jack Kaffenberger by a margin of 88 percent to 12 percent. In 2004, Jordan defeated Kaffenberger again, this time by a smaller margin of 79 percent to 21 percent. In May 2006, Jordan won the Republican primary race for the 4th Congressional district of Ohio.

Despite the strong anti-Republican mood in Ohio that year, Jordan skated to victory in the general election, defeating Democrat Rick Siferd, 60% to 40%.  The 4th has long been considered as one of the most (if not the most) Republican districts in Ohio and the nation; the district and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but 16 years since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nHe was reelected in 2008, defeating Democrat Mike Carroll 65% to 35%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/electResultsMain/2008ElectionResults/congress110408.aspx |title=U.S. Congress: November 4, 2008 |publisher=Sos.state.oh.us |date=November 4, 2008 |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJordan chaired the [[Republican Study Committee]] during the 112th Congress.
