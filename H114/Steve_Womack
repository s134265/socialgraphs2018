The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman.  He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=624472</ref> In the June runoff, he defeated [[Arkansas Senate|State Senator]] and fellow Rogers resident [[Cecile Bledsoe]] 52%-48%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=648529</ref>\n\nIn the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487764</ref>\n\n====2012====\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Arkansas, 2012#District 3}}\nWomack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid.  However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record.  As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2012/07/09/ken-aden-dropping-out-of-3rd-district-congressional-race  |title=Ken Aden dropping out of 3rd District congressional race|date=July 9, 2012|accessdate=August 15, 2012|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|first=Max|last=Brantley}}</ref> He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705043</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nIn 2011, Womack filed an amendment to a spending bill in an attempt to defund [[Barack Obama]]'s teleprompter.<ref>http://gawker.com/5763476/republican-tries-to-defund-obamas-teleprompter</ref>{{better source|date=October 2016}}\n\nOn February 14, 2013, Womack sponsored {{USBill|113|HR|684}}, the [[Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013]], a bill that would allow states to charge and collect sales taxes on internet purchases.<ref name=684sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 684 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/684|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref>  Supporters say the bill will create a \"level playing field\" between online retailers and brick and mortar retailers,<ref name=rilaPR>{{cite web|title=Bill Before U.S. Senate Will End Special Treatment of Online-Only Retailers|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130422-910447.html|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref> while opponents argue that the bill would increase the power of the states, threaten consumer privacy, increase taxes, and hurt small businesses.<ref name=cei1>{{cite web|last=Melugin|first=Jessica|title=Facts on the Marketplace Fairness Act (S. 743, formerly S. 336)|url=http://cei.org/web-memo/facts-marketplace-fairness-act-s-743-formerly-s-336|publisher=Competitive Enterprise Institute|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=NTU1>{{cite web|title=NTU urges all Senators to vote \"NO\" on S. 743, the \"Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA) of 2013.\"|url=http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/economy/va13-0422-s-743-mfa.html|publisher=National Taxpayers Union|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=wearehere1>{{cite web|title=WE R HERE: Opposition to Senate Internet Tax Act Grows|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/r-opposition-senate-internet-tax-164800167.html|publisher=Yahoo!Finance|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 Womack signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2010/04/womack.pdf</ref>\n\nIn a 2015 episode of his show [[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]], [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] criticized Womack for blocking the enforcement of laws proposed by the [[Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration]] that would have protected [[chicken]] farmers from being threatened or punished by the companies they work for if they spoke out regarding their farming experiences.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/john-oliver-vs-chicken-118510 | title=John Oliver vs. chicken | work=Politico | date=1 June 2015 | accessdate=29 March 2016 | author=Haas, Nathaniel}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations]]'''\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government|Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government]]\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies]]\n*[[Republican Study Committee]]\n\n===Caucus memberships===\n*[[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]]\n\n==Personal life==\nWomack attends Cross Church Pinnacle Hills, a [[Southern Baptist]] church in [[Rogers, Arkansas]].<ref name=Baptist>{{cite news|last=Staff|first=|title=Ten Southern Baptists sworn in as new reps.|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=34378|accessdate=25 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226010629/http://www.bpnews.net/34378|archivedate=25 December 2014|newspaper=Baptist Press|date=5 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ {{ushr|Arkansas|3|}}: Republican Primary Results 2010\n|-\n!
