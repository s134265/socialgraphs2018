He was chairman of the Delaware Health Care Commission, the Interagency Council on Adult Literacy, the Criminal Justice Council, the Center for Education Technology, and the Livable Delaware Advisory Council. In 2002 he launched the education initiative \"Models of Excellence in Education\" to identify practices in schools that have raised student achievement. Carney was also selected by other Lieutenant Governors as chairman of the National Lieutenant Governors Association from July 2004 to July 2005.\n\nCarney has long been an advocate for wellness issues in Delaware, sponsoring \"BeHealthy Delaware\" and \"The Lt. Governor's Challenge\" to encourage Delawareans to be more active and address the State's high rate of chronic diseases. He fought for Delaware's public [[smoking ban]] to improve health, cut cancer rates, and discourage teens from starting to smoke.\n\nAfter completing his tenure as Lieutenant Governor in 2009, Carney served as president and chief operating officer of Transformative Technologies, which is investing in the DelaWind project, to bring offshore wind turbine construction to Delaware.<ref>[http://www.sussexcountian.com/news/x1017430518/Carney-to-join-energy-firm-after-leaving-office Sussex Countian, 1/8/09: \"Carney to join energy firm after leaving office\"]</ref> He planned to step down in early 2010 to concentrate on his U.S. House campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tommywonk.com/2009/10/john-carney-and-delawind.html|title=TommyWonk|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2008 gubernatorial campaign===\n[[File:John c carney.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Carney giving a speech]]\n{{See also|Delaware gubernatorial election, 2008}}\nCarney sought the Democratic nomination for the office of Governor in 2008, as incumbent Governor [[Ruth Ann Minner]] was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term.

Carney faced Republican [[Glen Urquhart (Republican politician)|Glen Urquhart]], Independent Party of Delaware Earl R. Lofland, Libertarian Brent A. Wangen, and Blue Enigma Jeffrey Brown. The seat had been held since 1993 by Republican [[Michael Castle]], who declined to seek re-election to the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate seat once held by Vice President [[Joe Biden]]. In the first week of October, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind Poll released the results of its opinion research, showing Carney with a 15-point advantage over Urquhart, 51%-36%; well ahead in New Castle County (56-32) but running even with Urquhart (43-43) in the downstate counties of Kent and Sussex.<ref>\"Poll: Dem leads Republican in open Del.

In a debate with Kovach, Carney stated, \"I will continue to do in Washington what I did in Delaware: work across the aisle to get things done. I learned early on that compromise is part of life.\" Speaking on the [[Affordable Care Act]] (commonly called Obamacare), Carney stated that it \"is not perfect\" but that it is the \"only chance we have to get costs under control.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Mace|first=Ben|url=http://www.doverpost.com/article/20121016/NEWS/121019802?template=printart|title=Citizens protest; Pires calls Carper corrupt, unfit at Delaware debates|newspaper=The Dover Post|location=Dover, DE|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}</ref> Carney was re-elected in a landslide, with 64% of the vote to Kovach's 33%.\n\n;2014\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives election in Delaware, 2014}}\nCarney ran for re-election to a third term in 2014.
