Fleischmann filed a new bill called the \u201cStop Green Initiative Abuse Act of 2011\u201d which would repeal the Department of Energy\u2019s \u201cWeatherization Assistance Program\u201d. This program attempts to assist low-income families in lowering their energy bills by adding energy efficient caulking and insulation to homes. A December 2010 report from the Tennessee Comptroller\u2019s Office concluded that funds for the program had been \u201cwasted or misspent\u201d.
