His district was numbered the [[New York's 24th congressional district|24th]] during his first two years in Congress; since 2013, it has been the {{ushr|NY|22|22nd district}}.\n\n== Early life, education, and business career ==\nHanna was born in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and raised in [[Marcy, New York|Marcy]]. His grandparents owned a [[dairy farm]] in [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]]. He graduated from Whitesboro High School in Marcy. Then, he graduated from [[Reed College]] with a bachelor's degree in [[Economics]] and [[Political Science]]. After college, Hanna returned to New York to start his own construction business called Hanna Construction.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/AP130006b0837c4a4a8165804738532220.html Clinton stumps for NY House Dems in tight races] ''[[Associated Press]]'' November 1, 2010</ref> Hanna is of [[Lebanese American|Lebanese descent]].<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E1678-4 \"Honoring Lebanon on it's 70th Independence Day\" Hon.

In 2010, he ran in a rematch and won.\n\nDue to redistricting, Hanna ran in the new [[New York's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]] in 2012.\n\nIn his 2012 campaign for re-election against Democrat [[Dan Lamb]], television stations [[WUTR]] in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[WSYR-TV|WSYR]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] announced they would jointly air a debate between Hanna and Lamb. Hanna declined to participate, citing another scheduled televised debate and five that would not be televised. The stations said that if Hanna did not appear, they would air a 30-minute question-and-answer session with Lamb. According to Steve Merren, the vice president and general manager of WUTR's parent company, [[Nexstar Broadcasting Group]], Hanna then contacted Merren. In an email to staff, Merren stated, \"He indicated to me that we would not be considered for his ad dollars and our level of cooperation in the future could be affected.\" Merren then directed that WUTR not go ahead with the broadcast. Both Merren and a Hanna spokeswoman denied that threats had been made. After the inadvertent disclosure of the internal email, Merren told the press that Hanna \u201cdid not say he would pull his ad dollars.\" The Hanna campaign said that his conversation with Merren had been \"nothing more than a courtesy call\". The Lamb campaign said that Hanna was \"using his money to influence the journalistic decisions of a local news agency.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = GOP Congressman Threatens Local News Station for Covering Debate| publisher = [[Common Dreams]]| date = October 6, 2012 | url = http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/318-66/13825-gop-congressman-threatens-local-news-station-for-covering-debate| accessdate = October 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Email: Hanna discussed pulling ads after debate flap with WUTR| publisher = [[Observer-Dispatch]]| date = October 6, 2012 | url = http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1931761214/Email-Hanna-discussed-pulling-ads-after-debate-flap-with-WUTR | accessdate = October 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Tenure ===\nHanna is a member of the conservative [[Republican Study Committee]] and the centrist [[Republican Main Street Partnership]].

New York already has already passed similar legislation into law within the State of New York, but the practice remains legal in 29 U.S. states.  But Rep Hanna is one of several Republican co-sponsors of the bill who refused to sign a Discharge Petition on the bill \u2013 a parliamentary maneuver that allows a majority of members of Congress to bring any bill to the floor, even if the leadership opposes doing so.\n\nIn June 2013, Hanna voted against proposed legislation to ban [[abortions]] after 20 weeks of pregnancy except for victims of [[rape]] or [[incest]] who have reported the crime to authorities. He opposes partial birth abortions, but stated that he was unable to support this legislation because it would cast aside exception for the health of the mother, and it fails to adequately account for unique circumstances that can arise after 20 weeks because every pregnancy is specific.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2013/06/18/hanna-sole-new-york-republican-to-oppose-house-abortion-bill/ |title=Hanna sole New York Republican to oppose House abortion bill |last1=Tumulty |first1=Brian |date=June 18, 2013 |publisher=Politics on the Hudson |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2016, Hanna became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to say that he will vote for [[Hillary Clinton]] for president over [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], referring to the Republican nominee as \"a national embarrassment\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep.
