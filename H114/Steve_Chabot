Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]]. Of the bill, Representative Chabot said \"I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime...But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job.
