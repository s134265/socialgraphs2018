This Act seeks to both improve education in the nation\u2019s public schools and to protect the environment by \u201ccreating a new environmental education grant program, providing teacher training for environmental education, and including environmental education as an authorized activity under the Fund for the Improvement of Education.\u201d<ref name=\"SiteBio\" /> NCLI also requires states that participate in the environmental education grant programs to develop a plan to ensure that high school graduates are environmentally literate.

The primary campaign included State Senator [[Paula Hollinger]], former Baltimore City Health Commissioner Peter Beilenson, and former Maryland Democratic Party Treasurer Oz Bengur. Sarbanes won the nomination on September 12, 2006 with 31.9% of the vote. His Republican opponent in the general election was Annapolis marketing executive John White. However, the 3rd is a heavily Democratic district that has been in that party's hands since 1927, and few expected Sarbanes to have much difficulty in the election.  Sarbanes also benefited from name recognition; his father represented the district from 1971 to 1977.  On November 7, 2006, Sarbanes won the general election with 64% of the vote, while White received 34% of the vote and Libertarian Charles Curtis McPeek received 2%.  He has been reelected four times with no substantive opposition.\n\n[[Image:Sarbanes and Dixon cutting ribbon at 2007 Baltimore Greek Independence Day Parade.jpg|thumb|right|Sarbanes and Baltimore Mayor [[Sheila Dixon]] cut the parade ribbon at the 2007 Baltimore Greek Independence Day Parade.]]\n\n===Campaign finance===\nIn the 2008 election cycle, the Sarbanes campaign\u2019s income totaled $1,012,936 and his campaign spent $799,506.<ref name=\"finance1\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.votesmart.org/finance.php?can_id=66575\n| title = Representative John P.
