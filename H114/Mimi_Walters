Krogius \"Mimi\" Walters''' (born May 14, 1962) is an [[United States|American]] politician who is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[California's 45th congressional district]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], she was a member of the California State Senate for the 37th District from 2012 to 2015.  She previously represented the 33rd Senate District from 2008 to 2012 before redistricting.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  She also served in the California State Assembly from 2004 to 2008, where she served in the Republican leadership as Assistant Republican [[Floor Leader|Leader]] and Vice Chair of the [[Appropriation (law)|Appropriations]] Committee.\n\nOn November 4, 2014, Walters was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[CA-45|California\u2019s 45th congressional district]], formerly held by [[John B.T. Campbell III|John Campbell]]. She was subsequently elected by her colleagues as the Freshman Class Representative to the [[House Republican Conference]] leadership team for the [[114th United States Congress]].\n\n==Early years and education==\nWalters earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1984. Before her election to the [[California State Assembly]], Walters was a [[stockbroker]].\n\n==Political career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2016}}\nWalters was Councilwoman and Mayor of [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]] during 1996\u20132004, and helped defeat efforts to convert [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]] to a commercial airport. She was elected in 2004 to represent the 73rd Assembly District, which includes coastal [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] county communities of [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]], [[Laguna Hills, California|Laguna Hills]], [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]], [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]], [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], and [[Aliso Viejo, California|Aliso Viejo]].\n\nSince the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Kelo v. City of New London|Kelo v. New London]]'' in June 2005, Walters has been at the forefront of amending California government acquisition and the regulation of private property laws. She introduced two bills, AB 590 and AB 1990, in the 2005\u201306 session on these topics.  After both bills failed in committee by party line votes, Walters became a leading figure in the campaign for [[California Proposition 90|Proposition 90]]. She was named honorary chair of the Save Our Homes initiative campaign. Supporters of Proposition 90 referred to their effort as protecting property rights. The initiative received over one million signatures to qualify for the November 2006 ballot. Proposition 90 failed with 48% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2007\u20132008 session, Walters introduced ACA 2, a state Constitutional Amendment to change government acquisition and the regulation of private property by California local governments. Walters introduced a package of bills in February 2011 to address the California pension crisis, SB 520 through SB 528.<ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/03/06/3453456/pensions-emerge-as-key-issue-in.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn an op-ed written by Senator Walters in October 2012, Walters questioned the wisdom of creating a state-run retirement pension plan for private-sector workers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walters|first=Mimi|title=State-Run Private Sector Retirement Plans Subsidized by Taxpayers Coming in 2013|url=http://district37.cssrc.us/content/state-run-private-sector-retirement-plans-subsidized-taxpayers-coming-2013|website=District37.cssrc.us|accessdate=2016-11-11}}</ref> The bill, SB 1234, established the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program for private-sector workers that requires employers that may not offer retirement plans to participate in the program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1234 |title=Bill Text - SB-1234 Retirement savings plans |website=Leginfo.legislature.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-11-11}}</ref>\n\nWalters is the co-founder of the California Women\u2019s Leadership Association (CWLA.)

She has also served on the Boards of the [[National Association of Women Business Owners]] (NAWBO) the Laguna Niguel Republican Women Federated, the [[American Cancer Society]], and the South Coast Medical Center Foundation.\n\n===2010 California State Treasurer election===\nIn January 2010, Walters announced that she would run for [[California State Treasurer]] against Democratic incumbent [[Bill Lockyer]]. She became the [[California Republican Party|Republican]] nominee for State Treasurer the following June.\n\n===Investigation by the Fair Political Practices Commission===\nIn early 2012, the Fair Political Practice Commission opened an inquiry as to whether Walters violated conflict-of-interest laws when her office assisted constituents who were having problems receiving feedback from California prison officials regarding the status of a financial claim that Senator Walters husband ultimately had an economic interest in.<ref name=\"mcgreevy\">{{cite web|author=Patrick McGreevy |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/15/local/la-me-walters-ethics-20120615 |title=Ethics panel investigates state Sen.

But last year, the new California Citizens Redistricting Commission re-drew the state\u2019s legislative districts. To run in the newly drawn 37th Senate District, Walters says she moved to Irvine. Young and two registered Republicans who have joined in the suit say Walters\u2019 move was pure fiction. According to the suit, Walters and her husband, David, have lived in a 14,000-square-foot mansion in Laguna Niguel since 1999. Then, this year, the suit says that Walters changed her voter registration to reflect that she\u2019s living in a 570-square-foot apartment in Irvine with no dishwasher or washer/dryer hook ups.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=State Sen.
