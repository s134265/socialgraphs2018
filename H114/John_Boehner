In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]]. During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.\n\nIn the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker.

But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried \u2014 but repeatedly failed \u2014 to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.<ref>Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, John Bresnahan and Lauren French, \"Speaker John Boehner retiring from Congress at the end of October\" [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/speaker-john-boehner-retiring-from-congress-at-the-end-of-october-214056#ixzz3mlVEHpBf ''POLITICO'' Sept. 25, 2015]</ref>\n\nPaul Kane in the ''Washington Post'' emphasizes how none of the \"big deals\" he sought were ever reached:\n:Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.<ref>Paul Kane, \"After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the \u2018big deal\u2019 he wanted\" [http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-nearly-five-years-boehner-could-never-land-the-big-deal-he-wanted/2015/09/25/6bf22bd2-63b3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html ''Washington Post'' Sept 25, 2015]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Kane argues,  Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, \"a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner\u2019s easygoing style did not fit.\"<ref>Paul Kane, \"After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the \u2018big deal\u2019 he wanted\"</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBoehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the [[Wetherington, Ohio|Wetherington]] section of [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester Township]].
