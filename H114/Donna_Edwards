Edwards focused primarily on Wynn's voting record. Wynn, considered a conservative by African-American Democratic standards, was one of four Congressional Black Caucus members that voted for the 2002 Iraq War resolution. Edwards condemned the war before it started. Wynn eventually began to say he was misled by the Bush Administration and his vote was a mistake. Edwards opposed the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|repeal of the estate tax]], which Wynn voted for. Similarly, Edwards criticized Wynn's vote for the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act|bankruptcy bill of 2005]], which eliminated some bankruptcy protections for individuals. Wynn supported the energy bill promoted by Vice President and former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney. Wynn opposed the net neutrality bill of 2006, which Edwards supports.\n\nOn August 16, 2006, before a debate at [[Prince George's Community College]], an altercation occurred between Wynn's staffers and an Edwards volunteer, leaving the volunteer with a bloody gash to the head.<ref name=altercation>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701531.html|title=Supporters Scuffle At Candidate Forum|date=2006-08-18|accessdate=2008-03-13|work=[[Washington Post]]|first=Ovetta|last=Wiggins}}</ref> This event brought much media attention to the race.\n\nOn August 30, 2006, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' endorsed Edwards in the primary race.<ref name=WaPoEndorsement>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/29/AR2006082901302.html|title=For Congress in Maryland|date=2006-08-30|accessdate=2008-03-13|work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref>\n\nThe primary was held on September 12, 2006.
