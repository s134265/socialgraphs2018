Comer''' (born August 19, 1972) is an American politician from the Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]] who currently represents the state's  [[Kentucky's 1st congressional district|1st congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He previously served as the Agriculture Commissioner of Kentucky from 2012 to 2016 and in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 2000 to 2012. From 2011 to 2015, Comer was the only Republican holding a non-federal statewide elected office in Kentucky.\n\nComer sought the Republican nomination for [[Governor of Kentucky]] in the [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2015|2015 election]]. After losing, he successfully sought the Republican nomination for {{ushr|KY|1}} to succeed fellow Republican [[Ed Whitfield]]. On November 8, 2016, Comer won both a full term to the seat for the next Congress and also a special election which allowed him to serve the remainder of Whitfield's term.\n\n==Early life and education==\nComer is a native of [[Tompkinsville, Kentucky]]. He received a bachelor's degree in agriculture from [[Western Kentucky University]]. In college, he served as President of the Kentucky [[Future Farmers of America]]. After college, he started a {{convert|950|ha|disp=flip}} farm with his family. He also served as a director of a local bank for twelve years.\n\n==Early political career==\nHe served as President of the [[Monroe County, Kentucky|Monroe County]] Chamber of Commerce from 1999 until his 2000 election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] at the age of 27.  In his first election in 2000, the incumbent, Comer's former business partner, Billy Polston, was too ill to seek re-election.  Comer ran against and defeated Polston's wife, Donnie Polson.  Comer did not face another opponent until he ran for Commissioner of Agriculture in 2011.\n\n==Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture==\n[[File:James Comer Kentucky National Guard.jpg|thumb|left|Comer speaking to members of the [[Kentucky National Guard]] in 2013]]\nIn 2011, Comer ran for the position of Agriculture Commissioner; the incumbent, [[Richie Farmer]], was [[Term limits in the United States|term limited]]. In the election, Comer was the only Republican to win election to a statewide executive office. Comer had the highest percentage of the vote of any candidate on the ballot. He raised $606,766 while his opponent raised $204,287.<ref>Kentucky Registry of Election Finance</ref> He took office on January 2012 and is eligible for re-election in 2015.
