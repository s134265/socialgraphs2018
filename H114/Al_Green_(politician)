The district includes most of southwestern [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], including most of that city's share of [[Fort Bend County]].  It also includes most of [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nGreen was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. He attended [[Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University|Florida A&M University]] and transferred to [[Tuskegee University]]. He later went on to receive his [[Juris Doctor]] in 1974 from the [[Thurgood Marshall School of Law]] at [[Texas Southern University]]. After receiving his law degree and being admitted to the [[State Bar of Texas|Texas Bar]], he remained in [[Houston]] and currently lives in the [[Alief, Houston|Alief]] community.\n\nIn 1978, Green was elected [[Justice of the Peace#Texas|Justice of the Peace]] in [[Harris County, Texas]], in the Precinct 7, Place Two position. He held this position for 26 years.\n\nA former trial lawyer, Green co-founded the firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. He also served as president of the [[Houston]] [[NAACP]] and, during his term as the organization's leader, membership increased sevenfold. While serving as NAACP leader, he focused on increasing minority hiring in [[Texas]] and forming alliances with Hispanic groups.\n\nGreen is a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite press release|title=U.S. Senate approves resolution |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity |date=2006-11-06 |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/PressNewsDetails.php?newsID=25&newsCat=Press+Release |accessdate=2008-12-31 |quote=Alpha Phi Alpha is an exceptional organization that deserves to be recognized and honored for all of its many great achievements. The fraternity has helped shape more than 175,000 young men into extraordinary leaders who contribute positively to their communities and the world. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607163858/http://www.alphaphialpha.net/PressNewsDetails.php?newsID=25&newsCat=Press+Release |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nWhile still serving as a Justice of the Peace, Green ran for [[List of mayors of Houston|Mayor of Houston]] in 1981, finishing a distant fifth in the primary.\n\nIn 2004, Green entered the Democratic primary for the 9th District. The district had previously been the 25th, represented by freshman Democrat [[Chris Bell (politician)|Chris Bell]]. However, Bell was placed in significant jeopardy as a result of the [[2003 Texas redistricting]]. Although the district was heavily Democratic, it had a significantly larger number of blacks and Latinos than its predecessor. The old 25th had been 65 percent white, while the new 9th was 17 percent white, 37 percent black and 33 percent Latino.  This left Bell vulnerable to a primary challenge from a black or Latino Democrat, and prompted him to file an ethics challenge against [[Tom DeLay]].\n\nIn the March 9 primary, Green crushed Bell with 66 percent of the vote to Bell's 31 percent. He beat the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee Annette Molina in November. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced only a Libertarian in 2008.  This is not surprising given this district's partisan tilt; with a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+22, it is the second-most Democratic district in Houston.\n\nWhile in Congress, Green has focused on issues similar to those that he worked for while with the NAACP. Fair housing and hiring practices for the poor and minorities are some of his greatest concerns.\n\n==Political positions==\nGreen, a Democrat, shows strong [[American Liberalism|liberal]] tendencies on social issues.\n\nHe is [[pro-choice]], and consistently votes accordingly. On October 13, 2011, he voted against an amendment to the [[Affordable Care Act]], which prevented insurance gained through the Act to cover abortions.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/49680/al-green#.UKq8no7R30c|title=Al Green's Voting Records - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref> The bill passed convincingly in the House. Green has voted against eight other bills proposed in the House that would prevent any government spending to cover abortion. Due to this, he has received 100% ratings from [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], while receiving a 0% rating from the [[National Right to Life Committee]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/49680/al-green#.UKq-5I7R30c|title=Al Green's Ratings and Endorsements - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref>\n\nGreen also supports [[gun control]]. He spoke out after the [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin shooting]], asking members of the African-American community to show faith in the justice system and let the courts do their job and convict George Zimmerman.<ref>http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/221157-rep-wilson-calls-for-debate-on-racial-profiling-in-wake-of-zimmerman-arrest)</ref> The [[National Rifle Association]] gave him a rating of 0%, and [[Gun Owners of America]] rated him 25%, while the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] gave him a Lifetime Score of 83%.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nOn budget issues, Congressman Green strongly follows his party\u2019s views. He has supported every budget bill proposed during [[Barack Obama|President Obama\u2019s]] term. However, during [[George W. Bush|President Bush\u2019s]] term, he voted against all bills to cut government spending and taxes.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Green also voted for President Obama's [[Effects of the 2008\u20132010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|bailout of the Auto Industry in 2009]].<ref name=autogenerated2 /> On December 10, 2008, he wrote a statement supporting the bailout, saying, \u201cThe auto bailout is really about bailing out people, and the people of this country... I think that [how tax dollars are spent] is a legitimate concern for the American people, but I do think, with the proper strings attached, we can bail out the people...who may lose their jobs.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/26202-auto-bailout-is-really-about-bailing-out-people-rep-al-green|title=Auto Bailout Is Really About Bailing Out People (Rep. Al Green)|work=TheHill}}</ref>\n\nCongressman Green is a member of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus. He is a strong supporter of holding on to [[Pakistan]] as an ally in South Asia. After the assassination of [[Benazir Bhutto|former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto]] on December 27, 2007, which initially destabilized the country as riots erupted, Green issued a statement condemning the assassination as a \u201cdastardly effort to circumvent the democratic process.\u201d He announced the US\u2019s continued alliance with Pakistan, and urged Pakistanis to continue pushing towards democracy, \u201cknowing that freedom, justice, and democracy are difficult to achieve.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/26718-democratic-pursuits-vital-to-pakistans-future-rep-al-green|title=Democratic Pursuits Vital to Pakistan's Future (Rep.

He emphasized the need for the [[Lame duck session|lame duck Congress]] to work together to reform the budget.
