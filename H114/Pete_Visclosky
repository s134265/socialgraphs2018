He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the dean of the [[United States congressional delegations from Indiana|Indiana congressional delegation]]. The District lies in Northwest [[Indiana]]. Redistricting passed by the Indiana General Assembly in 2011 changed the district's boundaries, effective January 2013, to include all of Lake and Porter counties as well as the western and northwestern townships of LaPorte County, while shifting Benton, Newton, and Jasper counties out of the district. Much of the population is based in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]].\n\n==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==\nVisclosky was born in Gary, Indiana, the son of John and the late Helen (n\u00e9e Kauzlaric) Visclosky. He is of Croatian-Slovak descent.<ref>http://svu2000.org/cs_america/legislators.htm U.S. legislators\nwith Czech-Slovak roots at ''Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences.''</ref> He was educated at [[Andrean High School]] in [[Merrillville, Indiana]]. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting at [[Indiana University Northwest]] in [[Gary, Indiana]] and went on to earn his [[juris doctor]] from [[Notre Dame Law School]]. At [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Visclosky earned a Master of Laws in International and Comparative Law. He worked as a lawyer and staff member of United States Representative [[Adam Benjamin, Jr.|Adam Benjamin]] before entering the House.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1984, Visclosky ran for Congress in [[Indiana's 1st congressional district]].

He served as Chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus when the Democrats had control of the House, and currently serves as the Vice Chair.  He is also a former Chair of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee and the current Ranking Member.\n\nVisclosky is one of the 126 Democrats who voted against the [[Iraq War Resolution]]. He also is a supporter of high tech solutions as a way to revive the American blue collar work force, and as a way to decrease crime.\n\n;PMA Group investigation\nThe ''[[Washington Times]]'' reported in March 2009 that Visclosky had received, over ten years, $1.36 million in campaign donations from clients of the [[PMA Group]].  In 2007 and 2008, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]], of which Visclosky is a member, directed $137 million in government purchasing to PMA's clients. In May 2009, Visclosky received subpoenas in the [[grand jury]] investigation into PMA Group, the first member of Congress to be subpoenaed in the investigation.<ref>Bendavid, Naftali and Davis, Susan, \"[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124362015474866997.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Indiana Congressman Receives Subpoena in Lobbying Probe]\", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 29, 2009.</ref> The Congressman was later cleared of all charges by the [[House Ethics Committee]], who detailed in a 305-page report that \"Simply because a member sponsors an earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign contributor does not, on these two facts alone, support a claim that a member's actions are being influenced by campaign contributions\".<ref name=\"bloomberg\">{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/85636792.html |title=Ethics panel clears Murtha on donations |last=Salant |first=Jonathan |date=February 27, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302141857/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/85636792.html |archivedate=March 2, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the House Ethics Committee ended its investigation, clearing Visclosky and Republican former Representative [[Todd Tiarht]] of Kansas.
