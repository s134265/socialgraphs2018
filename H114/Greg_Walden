He was elected to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was appointed to the [[Oregon State Senate]] to fill a vacancy that opened up when [[Wes Cooley]] was elected to the U. S. House. Walden rose to the position of assistant majority leader in the Senate and was considering a bid for Oregon Governor in 1994. However, upon discovering that the son he and his wife were expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for Governor and to not seek re-election to the state Senate.  Their son died soon after birth.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980426/NEWS/304269997&cid=sitesearch\n|title=Profile: Walden hopes to snag May 19 GOP primary win\n|last=Wong\n|first=Peter\n|work=[[Mail Tribune]]\n|date=April 26, 1998\n|accessdate=August 25, 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter Cooley was caught in several lies about his military service, Walden announced he was running for the 2nd District seat as an independent.  However, he served as Oregon state chairman of [[Bob Dole]]'s presidential campaign, and he touted his \"strong Republican credentials\"\u2014implying that he would serve as a Republican if elected.

Walden easily won the Republican primary and breezed to election in November.  He has been reelected five times.  Though his district contains some liberal-leaning communities such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], most of the district leans heavily Republican, and Walden has always been reelected easily. In 2002, he defeated [[Democratic Party of Oregon|Democrat]] [[Peter J. Buckley|Peter Buckley]], who later became a member of the [[Oregon House of Representatives]]. In [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2006|2006]], Walden defeated Democratic candidate [[Carol Voisin]], and in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2008|2008]] he won a sixth term with 70% of the vote over Democrat Noah Lemas and [[Pacific Green Party|Pacific Green]] Tristin Mock.
