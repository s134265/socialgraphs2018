He taught Junior High School at Intermediate School 52 from 1969 to 1976 and at Intermediate School 174 after that.\n\n==New York State Assembly==\nIn 1977, Engel entered the special election for a seat in the [[New York State Assembly]] after the incumbent Democrat [[Alan Hochberg]] was forced to resign. He risked all of his life savings and won by 103 votes. He was the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] nominee in the special election, and on March 1, 1977, he defeated Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9502E0D9143DE034BC4A53DFB566838C669EDE ''Engel, a Liberal, Barely Wins Race for Assembly''] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on March 2, 1977 (subscription required)</ref>\n\nEngel was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1977 to 1988, sitting in the [[182nd New York State Legislature|182nd]], [[183rd New York State Legislature|183rd]], [[184th New York State Legislature|184th]], [[185th New York State Legislature|185th]], [[186th New York State Legislature|186th]] and [[187th New York State Legislature]]s.

In 2010, Engel wrote the [[Gestational Diabetes Act of 2010]], which passed the House, but didn't come to a vote in the Senate. The legislation could be re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]] for consideration. The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which, if untreated, could lead to [[Type 2 diabetes]] for both mother and child.\n\n===Global health===\nRep. Engel supports an improved re-authorization of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR). Within the PEPFAR bill, Engel included his bill, the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act.<ref>{{cite web |author=Robyn Shepherd |url=http://www.results.org/blog/mdr-tb_photos_displayed_in_u.s._capitol/ |title=http://www.results.org/blog/mdr-tb_photos_displayed_in_u.s._capitol/ |publisher=RESULTS |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> This measure provides increased U.S. support for international [[Tuberculosis management|Tuberculosis control]] activities, and promotes research to develop new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.\n\n===Energy===\nIn 2005, Engel, along with Congressman [[Jack Kingston]] (R-GA), introduced the Fuel Choices for American Security Act (H.R. 4409), later modified and re-introduced in 2007 as the DRIVE Act (H.R. 670) - the Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act - with more than 80 bi-partisan co-sponsors. It was designed to promote America's [[national security]] and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean [[alternative fuels]] and advanced vehicle technologies. It also called for increased tire efficiency - to increase a vehicle's gas miles.<ref>http://fdsys.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-01-24/pdf/CREC-2007-01-24-pt1-PgE193.pdf</ref>\n\nMany provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], which was signed into law on December 19, 2007, and became Public Law No. 110-140. This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown [[biofuel]]s like [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], and [[biobutanol]].\n\nOn July 22, 2008, Engel introduced, with Congressmen Kingston, [[Steve Israel]] (D-NY), and [[Bob Inglis]] (R-SC) the Open Fuel Standards Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1476/show |title=H.R.1476: Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009 - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> This bill requires 50 percent of new cars sold in the [[United States]] by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s capable of running on any combination of [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[gasoline]]. Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version. This bill was re-submitted in the [[111th United States Congress]] by Rep. Engel, Inglis, Israel, and [[Roscoe Bartlett]] (R-MD). It was re-introduced in the [[112th Congress]], with Rep. John Shimkus as the lead Republican. It will likely be re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]].\n\nEngel is the senior Representative from New York on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], and the Representative from New York on the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment.

In 2011, Rep. Engel introduced the [[Drug Testing Integrity Act]], which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests.\n\nIn 2010, Engel urged the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on [[cooperative apartment]] sales. Some developers and investors had been [[abusing the system]] by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades. The transfer fee, when used correctly, can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable. The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Engel introduced [[SNOPA]], the Social Network Online Protection Act. It guarantees online privacy, and ensures that employers and educational institutions cannot use personal data as a bargaining chip for employment or education. Employers/schools would be barred from requesting or requiring usernames or passwords to social media sites as part of the hiring, employment, or enrollment process. The bill has been re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]], with Rep. Michael Grimm as the Republican lead, and Rep. Jan Schakowski as an original co-sponsor.\n\n===International affairs===\nEngel is a supporter of recognizing [[Jerusalem]] as the capital of [[Israel]], and has also been an advocate for the causes of [[Albania]]n-Americans and ethnic Albanians in [[Kosovo]].
