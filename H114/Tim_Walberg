He also represented the district from 2007 to 2009.\n\n==Early life, education, and early career==\n\nWalberg was born and educated in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the son of Alice Ann and John A. Walberg. His paternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/walberg.htm|title=tim walberg|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He left a post-high school position with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] to pursue higher education. At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at [[Western Illinois University]] and attended [[Moody Bible Institute]], and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in religious education from [[Taylor University]]. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in [[New Haven, Indiana]], which concluded when he enrolled in the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] graduate school. After receiving an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in communications in 1978, Walberg and his young family relocated to [[Franklin Township, Lenawee County, Michigan|Tipton, Michigan]], where he led services at Union Gospel Church. He resigned his pastorship in 1982 in preparation for a successful bid for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]].\n\n==Michigan legislature==\nWalberg served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1998. He was succeeded by [[Doug Spade]] and the seat is currently held by [[Dudley Spade]], both Democrats.
