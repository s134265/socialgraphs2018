Republicans were bullish on their chances of winning [[Texas' 12th congressional district]]. It had once been represented by Democratic [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Jim Wright]], but legislative redistricting after the 1990 census had added areas with more Republican residents.\n\nGranger decided to run as a Republican, much to the dismay of local [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] activists, who criticized her as being too liberal.<!-- Based on what? --> She won handily, taking 56 percent of the vote over the Democrat [[Hugh Parmer]], also a former Fort Worth mayor.

That bill included a provision known as the GIPSA rider (Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Act), which prohibited USDA from using any money to implement rules authorized in the 2008 Farm Bill to protect chicken farmers from industry retaliation.\n\nThe USDA rule in question was developed over a six-year period, during which time USDA held numerous public forums and interviewed many farmers, processors and others. The final rule was designed by USDA to protect poultry, cattle and pig farmers from industry retaliation if they spoke out, and to ensure the farmers would have standing when negotiating contracts with large industrial meat-processing companies.\n\nRep. [[Marcy Kaptur]] (D-Ohio) proposed two amendments during the markup in an effort to remove some or all of the GIPSA rider and allow USDA to enforce the 2008 Farm Bill protections authorized in law. The first amendment she proposed attempted to remove the entire GIPSA rider, which is referred to here as section 730 of the bill. That amendment was declined. The second amendment focused specifically on allowing USDA enforcement of protections of farmers\u2019 right to speak about their conditions without fear of retaliation. Rep. Kaptur noted several examples of this kind of retaliation. That amendment was also declined.\n\nThe following Republican members from Texas voted against these Kaptur amendments: Kay Granger, [[John Culberson]], and [[John R. Carter]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nGranger won her eleventh term in the U.S. House in the general election held on November 8, 2016.
