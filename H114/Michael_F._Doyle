The incumbent Republican, [[Rick Santorum]], was elected to the [[United States Senate]]. Doyle won by almost 10 points, in one of the few bright spots in a bad year for Democrats. He was reelected three times with no substantive opposition.\n\nIn 2002, the Pennsylvania state legislature reconfigured Doyle\u2019s district, combining it with the Pittsburgh-based district of fellow Democrat [[William J. Coyne]].  In the process, the state legislature redrew most of western Pennsylvania's heavily Democratic areas into just two districts\u2014the reconfigured 14th District and the 12th District of [[John Murtha]].  The potentially explosive situation of having two Democratic [[incumbent]]s face each other in the primary was defused when Coyne announced his retirement (even though the district contained more of Coyne's former territory than Doyle's) leaving Doyle as the sole incumbent. The new district is by far the most Democratic district in western Pennsylvania, and Doyle was completely unopposed in 2002 and 2004; in 2006 and 2008, his only opposition was [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate [[Titus North]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06312/736544-177.stm | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | title = Anti-GOP tide costs Rep.
