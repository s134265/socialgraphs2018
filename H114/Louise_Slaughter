She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district, numbered as the 30th District from 1987 to 1993 and the 28th District from 1993 to 2013, is based in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and includes most of surrounding [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]]. She was the Chairwoman of the [[House Rules Committee]] from 2007 until 2011, and has served as ranking minority member of the Committee since 2011, a post she also held from 2005 to 2007.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Early life, education, and early political career==\nSlaughter was born''' Dorothy Louise McIntosh''' on August 14, 1929, in [[Lynch, Kentucky]], a [[coal mining]] town built by a subsidiary of [[U.S. Steel]]. She is the daughter of Daisy Grace (Byers) and Oscar Lewis McIntosh, a [[blacksmith]] for a coal mine.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/slaughter.htm</ref> She had two brothers, Philip and David as well as two sisters, Marjorie and Virginia. Her sister Virginia died {{When|date=November 2014}} of [[pneumonia]] while she was a child; Slaughter later cited this as her reason for earning degrees in [[microbiology]] and [[public health]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe family moved to [[Monticello, Kentucky]], where Slaughter attended high school. After graduating from high school, she enrolled at the [[University of Kentucky]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], where she studied [[microbiology]]. After graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]], she went on to earn a [[master's degree]] in [[public health]], also from the [[University of Kentucky]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter [[graduate school]], she went to work for [[Procter & Gamble]] in New York doing [[market research]]. Already involved in community groups like the [[Scouting in New York]] and the [[League of Women Voters]], Slaughter became increasingly concerned with local political and community issues. She was involved in a local environmental group, the Perinton Greenlands Association, which promoted recycling and opposed development of [[Hart's Woods]].  Slaughter decided to run for the Monroe County Legislature, winning on her third try. In 1975, while in the county legislature, she accepted an offer from then- [[New York Secretary of State]] [[Mario Cuomo]] to serve as his regional coordinator in the Rochester area. When Cuomo was elected [[lieutenant governor]] in 1979, Slaughter stayed on as his Rochester regional coordinator.\n\nIn 1982 local Democratic supporters approached Slaughter with a desire to see her run for the [[New York State Assembly]] against the Republican incumbent [[Thomas A. Hanna]], whom she defeated by a narrow margin. In 1984, she was re-elected by the more substantial margin of 10 points. She sat in the [[185th New York State Legislature|185th]] and [[186th New York State Legislature]]s.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n[[File:Albert Paley.jpg|thumb|left|Louise Slaughter meets with [[Albert Paley]]]]After four years in the state assembly, Slaughter decided to run for the Democratic nomination in [[New York's 30th congressional district]]. At the time, the district included downtown and eastern Rochester, most of eastern Monroe County, all of [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] and northern [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario]] counties. Moderate Republican [[Barber Conable]] had represented the district for 20 years before giving way in 1985 to a considerably more conservative Republican, [[Fred J. Eckert]]. Slaughter defeated Eckert by one point in the 1986 midterm election. Slaughter was the first Democrat to represent the 30th District since 1910, the first woman to represent [[Western New York]], as well as the first Democratic representative ever elected to a full term from the 30th since its creation in 1893. It had been renumbered several times in the previous century.\n\nRedistricting after the 1990 census renumbered Slaughter's district as the 28th District and turned it into a much more compact district comprising a narrow ribbon in Monroe County.  It included all of Rochester.  The new map put Slaughter into the same district as 30-year incumbent Republican [[Frank Horton (New York politician)|Frank Horton]], a close friend of Slaughter's.  The district had already been moving away from its moderate Republican roots, but the new territory made the district solidly Democratic.  Horton opted to retire, though he would have been a heavy underdog against Slaughter in any case.  She has been reelected seven more times since then.\n\nAfter the 2000 census, much of her district was merged with the 29th District of fellow Democratic Representative [[John LaFalce]], which included [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and the northern third of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Original plans called for LaFalce's district to be merged with that of Republican [[Jack Quinn (politician)|Jack Quinn]], who represented the other side of Buffalo. The new district retained Slaughter's district number, but was geographically more LaFalce's district. Only a thin [[tendril]] in [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]] connected Rochester to Buffalo. However, LaFalce did not seek a 15th term, effectively handing the seat to Slaughter.  With her election in 2002, she became the first woman to represent a significant portion of Buffalo in Congress.\n\nFollowing the 2010 census, Slaughter's district was renumbered as the [[New York's 25th congressional district|25th District]]. It was significantly more compact than its predecessor, as it took in most of Monroe County and lost its territory near Buffalo. However, it was also slightly less Democratic than her former territory. While President [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 28th with 68 percent of the vote, he would have carried the new 25th with 59 percent of the vote. She faced a vigorous and well-funded challenge from Republican Monroe County Executive [[Maggie Brooks]], but Slaughter won a 14th term with 57.4% of the vote, on November 6, 2012.\n\nIn the 2014 election, Slaughter narrowly defeated her Republican opponent, [[Gates, New York|Gates]] town supervisor Mark Assini, by 869 votes. After an extended period of vote counting, Assini conceded defeat on November 12, 2014, more than a week after the election was held.<ref>Abby Livingston, [http://atr.rollcall.com/election-results-2014-louise-slaughter-mark-assini/?dcz= \"Republican Concedes Tight New York House Race\"], ''Roll Call'', 12 November 2014.</ref><ref>Paige Lavender, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/13/mark-assini-midterm-election-results_n_5973590.html \"Mark Assini Concedes To Incumbent Louise Slaughter In New York Congressional Race\"], ''The Huffington Post'', 13 November 2014.</ref>  It was the first close race that Slaughter had faced since her initial bid for the seat.\n\n===Tenure===\n[[File:2012 03 01 Representative Louise Slaughter letter to John Boehner signed by 78 members of Congress.pdf|thumb|left|Congressional letter on [[Sandra Fluke]] by Louise Slaughter]] In January 1987, Slaughter entered Congress. In 1993, as a member of the [[United States House Committee on the Budget]] Slaughter secured the first $500 million [[Earmark (politics)|earmarked]] by Congress for [[breast cancer]] [[cancer research|research]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]]. Slaughter was also a co-sponsor of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, and fought to ensure the legislation included language guaranteeing that women and minorities were included in all federal health [[clinical trials]] from that point forward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:H.R.4:@@@P |title=Bill Summary and Status |publisher=United States Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref> Previously, all NIH-funded research was done on white males, even in trials related to predominantly female diseases such as breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/nyregion/q-a-dr-carolyn-m-mazure-women-s-health-women-s-differences.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Q&A/Dr. Carolyn M.

During that same year, she wrote legislation to make permanent the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[Office on Violence Against Women]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAlong with Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] (D-CT), she introduced the Women's Progress Commemoration Act which established the [[Women's Progress Commemorative Commission]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SgN_ZKlBMBMJ:www.nps.gov/wori/planyourvisit/upload/women%27s%2520progress%2520commission%2520report.pdf+Congressional+Women%27s+Progress+Commemorative+Commission&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a|title=Women's Progress Report 7/01|accessdate=2008-08-03|date=July 2001|publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2005, she authored the Fairness and Accountability in Broadcasting Act, which would reinstate the [[Fairness Doctrine]]. Along with Democratic Congressman [[John Conyers]], in April 2006 Slaughter brought an action against President [[George W. Bush]] and others alleging violations of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in the passing of the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]]. The case (''[[Conyers v. Bush]]'') was ultimately dismissed.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} After the 2006 mid-term takeover of the House by the Democratic Party, Slaughter was chosen to serve as Chairwoman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules]] at the start of the 110th Congress. She is the first woman in history to chair the Rules Committee.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn 2007, Slaughter introduced the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), which would limit the [[Antibiotic use in livestock|use of antibiotics in livestock feed]], to counter the threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louise.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1106&Itemid=1 |title=March 17, 2009 - Slaughter Introduces Bill to Curb Excessive Use of Antibiotics in Food Supply - Congresswoman Louise Slaughter |publisher=Louise.house.gov |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> She has reintroduced her legislation in every subsequent session of Congress.

She introduced and reintroduced this bill for 12.5 years, and could claim victory when the bill was signed into law on May 21, 2008. The [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] is designed to prohibit discrimination by employers or health insurers based upon an individual's genetic information.\n\nIn 2009, Slaughter wrote to the [[United States Department of Defense]] requesting an investigation into faulty body armor after reading an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', entitled, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/07/politics/07armor.html?_r=1& \"Pentagon Study Links Fatalities to Body Armor.\"] The article authored by Michael Moss reported that up to 80 percent of Marines who were killed in Iraq from wounds to the upper body could have survived if they had extra body armor. Slaughter's request resulted in the Department of Defense launching an investigation, recalling 16,000 pieces of body armor and replacing them with safer armor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodig.mil/pubs/documents/DODIG-2013-079.pdf |title=Department of Defense Inspector General- Advanced Combat Helmet Technical Assessment |publisher=United States Department of Defense |date=2013-05-29 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref>\n\nAs Chairwoman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules]], Slaughter was heavily involved in the writing of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and managed the rule for the legislation on the House Floor. Slaughter was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funding for elective abortions in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].\n\nIn March 2010, Slaughter proposed that a House rule be passed to expedite the passage of health care reform legislation. The rule allows the House to deem the Senate version of the health care reform bill \"already passed\" by the House without the House holding a recorded vote on the bill. Critics, who called the strategy the \"Slaughter Solution\", charged this proposed strategy was an affront to democratic principles and challenged its constitutionality.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703909804575123512773070080.html |title=Slaughter House Rules - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Ultimately this legislative strategy was never used to pass the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] through the House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20000837-503544/house-dems-abandon-slaughter-solution-for-health-bill/ |title=House Dems Abandon 'Slaughter Solution' for Health Bill |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-03-20 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref> Supporters observe that the courts have affirmed the rule's constitutionality, and that Republicans have used the rule repeatedly to pass major legislation such as the Patriot Act and the Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roper |first=Eric |url=http://www.startribune.com/blogs/88652547.html?elr=KArks:DCiUBcy7hUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU |title=Fact check: Bachmann gets it wrong on the \"Slaughter Solution\" |publisher=StarTribune.com |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Montopoli |first=Brian |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20000631-503544.html |title=Republicans Have Used \"Slaughter Solution\" Many Times - Political Hotsheet |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ornstein |first=Norman J. |url=http://blog.american.com/?p=11467 |title=Hypocrisy: A Parliamentary Procedure \" The Enterprise Blog |publisher=Blog.american.com |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>\n\nOn March 19, 2010, two days before the health care vote, a window in Slaughter's Niagara Falls office was broken with a brick.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/2010/03/19/993040/brick-thrown-through-window-in.html |title=Brick thrown through window in Slaughter's Falls office |publisher=The Buffalo News |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RIT building - Slaughter Building.jpg|thumb|The Louise M.
