It has Democrats, non-political independents, business owners, other individuals and people who don\u2019t pay attention to government, kind of on their toes, because they know it can happen to them.\" The Congressman went on to say that the only way out was to show bipartisan partnership among the Administration in order to \"...get this scandal off the front page [and] working with Republicans to get comprehensive tax reform done in a way that simplifies our code.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riponsociety.org/news_5-21-13.htm |title=This is something that sends chills down regular Americans\u2019 spines |date=May 21, 2013|publisher=The Ripon Society |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]]'''\n** [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]] (Chairman)\n** [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security|Subcommittee on Social Security]]\n** [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources|Subcommittee on Human Resources]]\n** [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures|Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures]] \n* [[Republican Main Street Partnership]]\n\n==Legislation==\n\n===School safety===\nTiberi introduced a bill with [[Ron Kind|Rep.

He only won by nine points in a district that had long been considered to be far friendlier to the Democrats than the neighboring 15th, despite Kasich's long tenure.  However, Tiberi hasn't faced a close race since, in part because his district was redrawn after the 2000 census.
