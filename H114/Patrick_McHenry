This was due to \"revelations of mismanagement and mistreatment at VA facilities in Phoenix and across the country.\" In a press release, McHenry said: \"The treatment of veterans by the Phoenix VA is nothing short of disgusting.  These brave Americans have given so much for our country and for them to be subjected to this horrendous treatment is repugnant.\nAfter I reviewed yesterday's interim report, it is clear that Secretary Shinseki has failed his most basic responsibility of caring for America's heroes.  The report found these issues not to be isolated incidents but rather systemic problems throughout the VA system, a system Secretary Shinseki has led since the President took the oath of office in 2009.  In light of these most recent revelations, I believe it is time Secretary Shinseki resign and allow for new leadership that will protect our nation's veterans. While the treatment of veterans uncovered in the report is awful, I must commend the staffs at both the Hickory outpatient clinic and Asheville VA Medical Center who have served the veterans in my district with distinction.

In part because of this, the [[Cook Political Report]] moved the race from \"Safe Republican\" to \"Likely Republican.\"  This meant that in [[Charlie Cook]]'s opinion, while McHenry still had a considerable advantage, a victory by Johnson could not be ruled out.  Shortly after the Cook Political Report's update, [[Stuart Rothenberg]] of the [[Rothenberg Political Report]], also a nonpartisan analysis of American politics and elections, addressed the race and indicated his opinion that an upset is unlikely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reader.feedshow.com/show_items-feed=af27380f84bb9685c27446d08e3c60eb|title=The Rothenberg Political Report[FeedShow RSS reader]|work=feedshow.com|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref>  McHenry won the 2008 election, 58% to 42%.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/7937/13362/en/reports.html | title = 2008 General Elections: Reports (unofficial results) | publisher = North Carolina State Board of Elections | date = November 6, 2008<!-- 13:34:08 EST -->| accessdate = November 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2010#District 10}}\nMcHenry easily defeated Democratic challenger Jeff Gregory.\n\n===2012===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2012#District 10}}\nMcHenry easily defeated Republican primary challengers Ken Fortenberry and Don Peterson in May 2012 with 73% of the vote in the redrawn 10th District.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.house.gov/mchenry/ Congressman Patrick McHenry] official U.S. House site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101028214308/http://www.mchenryforcongress.com/ Patrick McHenry for Congress]\n* {{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/North_Carolina/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Patrick_McHenry_%5BR-10%5D}}\n* {{C-SPAN|patrickmchenry}}\n{{CongLinks | congbio = m001156 | ballot = Patrick_T._McHenry | nndb = 293/000087032 | votesmart = 21031 | govtrack = 400644 | opencong = 400644 | rollcall = 20358 | fec = H4NC10047 | opensecrets = N00026627 | assets = patrick-mchenry | legistorm = 363/Rep_Patrick_McHenry_NC.html | followthemoney = | ontheissues = NC/Patrick_McHenry.htm | congress = patrick-mchenry/1792 | worldcat = | cspan = 1007062 | imdb = 2356166 | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = gIQA70nx9O }}\n* [http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Patrick_McHenry Profile] at [[SourceWatch]]\n* [http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=10402 Profile] at OurCampaigns.com\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Cass Ballenger]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[List of United States Representatives from North Carolina|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[North Carolina's 10th congressional district]]|years=2005\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-hon}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Adam Putnam]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of youngest members of the United States Congress|Baby of the House]]|years=2005\u20132009}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Aaron Schock]]}}\n|-\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Peter Roskam]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Chief Deputy Whip]]|years=2014\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Michael McCaul]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]|years=151st}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{NC-FedRep}}\n{{USHouseCurrent}}\n{{US House leaders current}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McHenry, Patrick}}\n[[Category:1975 births]]\n[[Category:Belmont Abbey College alumni]]\n[[Category:College Republicans]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:North Carolina Republicans]]\n[[Category:North Carolina State University alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Gastonia, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:21st-century American politicians]]"}]}}}}
