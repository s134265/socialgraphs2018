She \"warned her colleagues to be 'careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target.'\"<ref>Polner, Murray (2010-03-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/ Left Behind], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Lee explained, \"It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events\u2014anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration.... The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action.\"\n\nThis vote made nationwide news reports and brought about a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office. Although it appears to have reflected the beliefs of the majority of her constituents, the majority of responses from elsewhere in the nation were angry and hostile, some referring to her as \"communist\" and \"traitor\".
