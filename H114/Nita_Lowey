She served as a government official before entering elected politics and was once the Assistant Secretary of State of New York.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n[[File:Rep Nita Lowey.jpg|thumb|left|Congresswoman Lowey's official congressional headshot, 2007.]]Lowey was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[New York's 20th congressional district]] in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1988|1988]]. Following [[redistricting]] after the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], Lowey was elected from the [[New York's 17th congressional district|17th district]]. Her district is located in the northern suburbs of [[New York City]] and includes most of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] including, [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]], [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]], [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]], [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] and all of [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], including the county seat [[New City, New York|New City]], [[Haverstraw (village), New York|Haverstraw]], and [[Congers, New York|Congers]]. She used to represent parts of [[Queens]] and the [[Bronx]], until redistricting after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] created her current district.\n\nLowey strongly considered [[New York United States Senate election, 2000|running for the United States Senate in 2000]], but stepped aside when [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton]] announced her candidacy. Lowey was considered a top contender for appointment to Clinton's Senate seat after Clinton was nominated to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], but in a December 1, 2008 phone interview with the [[Associated Press]], she stated that she isn't interested in giving up her senior seat on the House Appropriations Committee.<ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CLINTON_SUCCESSOR?SITE=CASRP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Lowey received 69% of the vote against political newcomer [[Richard A. Hoffman]], a Wall Street investor and largely self-funded candidate who ran on a platform of opposing special interests and cutting federal taxes. Lowey emphasized her track record on homeland security issues, notably her work to reform the formula for distributing homeland security grants to states.\n\nIn 2006, also against Hoffman, Lowey won with 70%.\n\nLowey was re-elected to an eleventh term in 2008, with 68% of the vote against unsupported [[James C. Russell|James C. \"Jim\" Russell]].\n\n===Tenure===\nLowey received an \"A\" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s 2005 [http://www.drummajorinstitute.com/congress/drum-major-voting-summary.php?name=Lowey&state=NY&database=house Congressional Scorecard] on middle-class issues.

She was a member of the [[House Appropriations Committee]].{{When|date=February 2011}}\n\nOne of the notable causes she supports is the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], in support of which she appeared at a congressional hearing accompanied  by ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters Bert and Ernie.\n\nLowey has been a vocal advocate for a Security Council Resolution on the [[Darfur conflict|conflict in Darfur]]. She is responsible for the $500 million in the Emergency Spending Bill for Aid in Darfur. She is also pushing for $1.2 Billion in the next fiscal year.\n\nLowey voted for HR 2454, the \"Cap and Trade\" legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutpolitics.com/politicians/New%20York-NY/Lowey/Budget,%20Spending%20and%20Taxes |title=Political Voting Records: New York-NY, Lowey: Budget, Spending and Taxes |publisher=Aboutpolitics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>\n\nLowey voted for HR 1105, the 2009 Budget Bill.\n\n[[File:FEMA - 29664 - Administrator Paulison in New York April 23rd.jpg|thumb|Congresswoman Lowey, with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] Director [[R.

Because of the rancor and disruptions which marked so many of the so-called Town Hall meetings held in the summer of 2009 to discuss Health Care Reform, Lowey chose to present her point of view on Health Care Reform in a telephone conference call, the effectiveness of which was questioned by some of her constituents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2009/08/07/are-telephone-town-hall-meetings-democratic/ |title=Are telephone Town Hall meetings Democratic? &#124; Politics on the Hudson |publisher=Polhudson.lohudblogs.com |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> However, Lowey routinely appears around her district to talk one-on-one with her constituents at town fairs, events and public meetings.\n\n=== Iran deal ===\nLowey has announced her opposition to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], stating that \"In my judgment, sufficient safeguards are not in place to address the risks associated with the agreement.  Relieving UN sanctions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles and releasing billions of dollars to the Iranian regime could lead to a dangerous regional weapons race and enable Iran to bolster its funding of terrorists.   The deal does not explicitly require Iran to fully disclose its previous military work to the IAEA\u2019s satisfaction before sanctions relief is provided, and inspectors will not have immediate access to the most suspicious facilities. There are no clear accountability measures regarding punishment for minor violations, which could encourage Iran to cheat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lowey.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/lowey-opposes-p51-iran-agreement|title=Lowey Opposes P5+1 Iran Agreement}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations]]''' (Ranking Member)\n** [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security|Subcommittee on Homeland Security]]\n** [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies]]\n** [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs|Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs]] (Ranking Member)\n\n===Caucus memberships===\n* Congressional Women's Caucus\n* House Pro-Choice Caucus\n* Hudson River Caucus\n* [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]]\n* [[Israel Allies Caucus]]\n* Congressional Arts Caucus\n* National Eating Disorders Awareness Caucus\n\n=== 2016 superdelegate ===\nLike all Democratic members of Congress, Lowey was a [[superdelegate]] to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], pledged to support [[Hillary Clinton]].
