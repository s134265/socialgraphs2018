He faced freshman fellow Republican and 3rd District incumbent [[Jeff Landry]] of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].  Although the district was numerically Landry's district, it was geographically and demographically more Boustany's district.  Indeed, the new 3rd contained almost two-thirds of Boustany's former territory, while Landry retained only the western third of his former district. Landry led Boustany in third-quarter 2011 fundraising, $251,000 to $218,000.

Though most politicians shunned involvement in the heated race,  [[Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry|Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry]] [[Michael G.

The remaining 7,908 votes (2 percent) and 3,765 ballots (1 percent) were cast, respectively, for Republican Bryan Barrilleaux and the Libertarian Jim Stark.
