Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively [[Liberalism|liberal]] voting record, including support for [[abortion rights]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]] and increased [[environmentalism|environmental protections]].\n\nAfter Morella's re-election in 2000, Democratic [[Maryland Senate]] President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.|Thomas V. \"Mike\" Miller]] made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one [[redistricting]] plan after the 2000 Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate [[Mark Kennedy Shriver]] in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic than its predecessor.  It absorbed nine heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring [[Prince George's County]], an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.\n\nIn 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former [[Clinton administration]] aide Ira Shapiro. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.\n\nDuring the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept [[Tom DeLay]] and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, [[HMO]] reform, [[trigger lock]]s for handguns, and protecting the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[oil drilling]]. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.<ref name=\"apsanet.org\"/>  Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County.  However, Morella won most of the precincts she'd previously represented.\n\nProving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote.  However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.\n\nAfter the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic.  He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]], and lost his share of Prince George's County to the [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th district]].  In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily Republican Carroll County and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County.  Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over Republican Ken Timmerman with 63 percent of the vote.  While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.\n\n==Positions==\nVan Hollen has been endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]],<ref name=\"vote-smart.org3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/interest-group/122/brady-campaign-to-prevent-gun-violence|title=Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \u2013 Project Vote Smart|access-date=November 21, 2012}}</ref> a group which campaigns for more government regulation of guns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradycampaign.org|title=Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence|access-date=November 21, 2012}}</ref> Van Hollen received a 0% from the Gun Owners of America (GOA) in 2006.<ref name=\"Vote-smart.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/candidate/6098/chris-van-hollen-jr|title=Christopher Van Hollen, Jr. Summary \u2013 Project Vote Smart|work=Chris Van Hollen|access-date=November 20, 2012}}</ref> In September 2008, Van Hollen voted against repealing portions of the D.C.
