After voting against the bill, Hensarling said,\n\n{{quote|no one truly knows if this plan will work \u2013 though we all hope that it does. No one knows the true amount of taxpayer exposure. Treasury could spend $700 billion in no time flat and come right back to Congress for $700 billion more. Some believe the taxpayer will actually make money in the deal and I hope that proves true. But history as a guide, I have strong fears it will not. At what point do we finally bailout the American taxpayer from the unconscionable burden he or she faces from out of control Washington spending? I fear that the legislation passed by Congress remains more of a bailout than a work out. I fear it undermines the ethic of personal responsibility. I fear that it rewards bad behavior and punishes good. But my greatest fear is that it changes the role of the federal government in our free market economy, which despite its current problems, remains the envy of the world. How can we have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down? If we lose our ability to fail will we not in turn lose our ability to succeed? If Congress bails out some firms and sectors, how can it say no to others? We must always be very careful to ensure that any remedy does allow short-term gain to come at the cost of even greater long-term pain \u2013 that being the slippery slope to socialism. The thought of my children growing up in America with less freedom and less opportunity is a long-term pain I cannot bear.}}{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nFollowing September 29 House vote, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] dropped 777 points in a single day, its largest single-day point drop ever.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  The House subsequently passed the bill in a second vote on October 3.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nOn November 19, 2008 Hensarling was appointed by United States House of Representatives Minority Leader [[John Boehner]] to serve on the five-member [[Congressional Oversight Panel]] created to oversee the implementation of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act]].
