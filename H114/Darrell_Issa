According to Issa, he and his wife pooled their savings, sold their cars (a 1976 Mercedes and a 1967 VW [[Beetle]]) as well as a BMW motorcycle, and borrowed $50,000 from family members to invest in Quantum Enterprises, an electronics manufacturer run by a friend from [[Cleveland Heights]] that assembled [[bug zapper]]s, [[CB radio]] parts, and other consumer products for other companies. One of those clients, [[car alarm]] manufacturer Steal Stopper, would become the path to Issa's fortune. It was struggling badly, and he took control of it by [[foreclosure|foreclosing]] a $60,000 loan he had made to it when its founder, Joey Adkins, missed a payment. Adkins remained as an employee.<ref name=\"Lizza New Yorker story\"/>\n\nIssa soon turned Steal Stopper around, to the point that it was supplying [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] with thousands of car alarms and negotiating a similar deal with [[Toyota]].

In 1985, Issa sold the company to a California-based maker of [[home alarm]]s, and moved to the [[San Diego]] suburb of [[Vista, California|Vista]], where he has lived ever since, to work for the company.
