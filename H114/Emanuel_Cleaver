Cleaver currently represents {{ushr|MO|5}}, where he's served since 2005. The district includes the southern three-fourths of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], including all of the city south of the [[Missouri River]], as well as the more rural counties of [[Lafayette County, Missouri|Lafayette]], [[Ray County, Missouri|Ray]], and [[Saline County, Missouri|Saline]] east of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]]. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and in January 2010, Cleaver became chair of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].\n\nCleaver previously served on the Kansas City Council from 1979 to 1991, until he was elected [[List of mayors of Kansas City, Missouri|Mayor]], serving from 1991 to 1999. In 2004, Cleaver was elected to represent [[Missouri's 5th congressional district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nCleaver was born in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], the son of Marie (n\u00e9e McKnight) and Lucky G. Cleaver.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cleaver.htm</ref> He grew up in [[public housing]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]. He graduated from [[Prairie View A&M University]] where he became a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.

Cleaver is a cousin to exiled Kansas City [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] leader [[Pete O'Neal]]. In 1997, Cleaver attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a pardon for O'Neal from President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/world/a-black-panther-s-mellow-exile-farming-in-africa.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm</ref>\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\nAfter the compromise [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control Act]] deal had been reached to resolve the [[2011 United States debt ceiling crisis]] in August 2011, Cleaver wrote on [[Twitter]] calling it a \"sugar-coated Satan sandwich.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Seung Min|title=Debt-ceiling deal frustrates House liberals|publisher=Politico|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60423.html|accessdate=2 August 2011|date=1 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]]'''  \n**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity|Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity]]  (Ranking Member)\n**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology|Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology]]\n\n===Caucus membership===\n*[[Congressional Black Caucus]] (Chair)\n* Congressional Cement Caucus\n* Congressional Serbian Caucus\n\n===Tenure===\nDuring his tenure, Cleaver has voted with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] 95.8% of the time.<ref name=\"Voting Statistics\">{{cite web|title=Voting Statistics for Emanuel Cleaver|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/House/Missouri/Emanuel_Cleaver/VotingStatistics/|publisher=The Political Guide|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> He has been recognized as a congressman who is \"not shy about earmarks\" and has brought many tax dollars back to Kansas City.<ref name=\"Cleaver JCDC Biography\">{{cite news|title=Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, II |url=http://jacksoncountydemocraticcommittee.org/elected-officials/emanuel-cleaver/ |accessdate=19 June 2012 |newspaper=Jackson County Democratic Committee |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604022805/http://jacksoncountydemocraticcommittee.org/elected-officials/emanuel-cleaver/ |archivedate=4 June 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nCleaver has called for ethics charges against fellow [[U.S. Representative]]s [[Charlie Rangel]] and [[Maxine Waters]] to be dropped, saying \"The process has been tainted.\"<ref name=\"Cleaver ethics charges dropped\">{{cite news|last=Kraske |first=Steve |title=Cleaver wants ethics charges against Waters, Rangel dropped |url=http://midwestdemocracy.com/articles/kraske-cleaver-wants-charges-against-waters-rangel-dropped/ |accessdate=19 June 2012 |newspaper=The Kansas City Star |date=15 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Loan default===\nOn April 6, 2012, the ''Kansas City Star'' reported that [[Bank of America]] had sued Cleaver Company LLC over a commercial real estate loan for a [[Grandview, Missouri|Grandview]] car wash.

Despite having served in city government for 20 years, including eight years as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections. Cleaver went on to defeat former [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration official [[Jamie Metzl]] in the Democratic primary by a margin of 60-40 percent. In the general election, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Jeanne Patterson made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as the second-most Democratic district in Missouri (behind the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]-based [[Missouri's 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District]]). The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949. By comparison, McCarthy won 65 percent of the vote in 2002.\n\n===2008 Democratic Presidential Primary Election===\nDuring the course of the contentious 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, Cleaver endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=2953 Missouri Rep.

Cleaver said during the course of the primary he'd be shocked if Obama wasn't the next President but made it clear he still supported Clinton until she suspended her bid.\n\n==Electoral
