His home in Johnston County had been drawn into the district; it had previously been in the [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]].\n\nIn the Republican primary, Rouzer defeated both 2010 nominee [[Ilario Pantano]] and Randy Crow, but won just four of the district's twelve counties: Johnston (82%), Sampson (49%), Lenoir (43%), and Hoke (38%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/36596/80787/en/md.html?cid=201020007 |title=North Carolina State Board of Elections : State Wide Primary Election : 2012 |website=Results.enr.clarityelections.com |accessdate=2016-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=740235 |title=NC District 07- R Primary Race - May 08, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-03-04}}</ref>  However, his margin in Johnston County, the second-largest county in the reconfigured district, was enough for him to win.\n\nThe redrawn 7th is much more conservative and Republican than its predecessor. ''[[Roll Call (newspaper)|Roll Call]]'' rates the election as ''leans Republican''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/north-carolina-gop-nominee-attacks-mike-mcintyre-in-7th-district |title=North Carolina: GOP Nominee Attacks Mike McIntyre in 7th District - At the Races |website=Atr.rollcall.com |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nAfter an official tabulation showed that Rouzer had lost the election to McIntyre by 655 votes, Rouzer asked for a recount on November 21, 2012. After the recount, Rouzer conceded the race to McIntyre on November 28.  It was the closest House race in the country. [[Mitt Romney]] carried the district with 56 percent of the vote.\n\n==2014 congressional election==\nRouzer ran for the 7th district again in 2014. McIntyre retired rather than face a rematch.  Most pundits believed that with McIntyre's retirement, the seat would be an easy GOP pickup.  Even before his near-miss in 2012, the 7th had been trending Republican for some time.\n\nRouzer won the general election with almost 60% of the vote.  Upon taking office in January 2015, he became only the second Republican to represent a significant portion of eastern North Carolina in the House since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rouzer.house.gov Official House website]\n* [http://www.davidrouzer.com/ David Rouzer for Congress]\n* {{C-SPAN|davidrouzer02}}\n{{CongLinks | congbio = R000603 | ballot = David Rouzer | nndb = | votesmart = 102964 | govtrack = | opencong = | rollcall =  | politifact =  | legistorm = | fec = H2NC07096 | opensecrets = | assets = | followthemoney = | ontheissues = | congress = david-rouzer/2256 | cspan = davidrouzer | imdb = 6029602 | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = }}\n* [http://www.starnewsonline.com/section/topic0140 Collected news and commentary] at the ''[[Star-News]]'' (Wilmington)\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-par|us-hs}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox\n| before = [[Mike McIntyre]]\n| start=January 3, 2015\n| state=North Carolina\n| district=7}}\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Kathleen Rice]] <br><small>D-[[New York (state)|New York]] }}\n{{s-ttl|title=''[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]''|years=417th}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Steve Russell (politician)|Steve Russell]]<br><small>R-[[Oklahoma]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{NC-FedRep}}\n{{USHouseCurrent}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rouzer, David}}\n[[Category:North Carolina State Senators]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Johnston County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:North Carolina State University alumni]]\n[[Category:North Carolina Republicans]]\n[[Category:1972 births]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:21st-century American politicians]]"}]}}}}
