He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Early life, education, and business career==\nMeadows was born at a [[United States Army]] hospital in [[Verdun]], France where his father was serving in the Army and his mother worked as a civilian nurse.  His mother was from [[Sevierville, Tennessee]], and his father from [[Pineville, Arkansas]].\n\nHe grew up in [[Brandon, Florida]] and graduated from the [[University of South Florida]] in 1981 after briefly studying at [[Florida State University]]. During his collegiate years, Meadows joined [[Sigma Chi Fraternity]].\n\nIn 1987, Meadows started \"Aunt D's\", a small restaurant in [[Highlands, North Carolina]].  He later sold it and used the proceeds to start a real estate development company in the [[Tampa, Florida]] area.<ref>{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Brittney |date=October 18, 2012 |title=Candidate Profiles Continue as Election Looms: 11th Congressional District Seat; Mark Meadows |url=http://www.maconnews.com/news/3796-candidate-profiles-continue-as-election-looms |newspaper=Macon County News |location=Franklin, NC}}</ref>\n\nWhile living in Highlands, Meadows served as chairman of the Republican Party in [[Macon County, North Carolina|Macon County]], and was a delegate to several   state and national Republican conventions.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Election 2012: Winner U.S. Representative NC-11; Mark Meadows |url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mark-meadows--NC-H |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York, NY}}</ref>\n\nMeadows previously served on North Carolina's Board for Economic Development in Western North Carolina.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 12, 2012 |title=Meadows Officially Enters Race for Shuler's Seat |url=http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20120216/articles/120219824 |newspaper=BlueRidgeNow.com |location=Hendersonville, NC}}</ref>  In 2011 he moved to [[Cashiers, North Carolina]], where he now lives.

The district had been significantly altered in [[gerrymandering|redistricting]].  New lines were drawn straight through the middle of Warren Wilson College. Notably, it lost most of [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] to the [[North Carolina's 10th congressional district|10th district]], while picking up some heavily Republican territory in the foothills.

Rep. Chaffetz, a member of the House Republican leadership, removed Meadows due to Meadows' vote against a procedural motion presented by Republican leadership. Meadows was one of 34 Republicans that voted against the motion to allow for consideration of President [[Barack Obama]]'s request for fast-track authority on trade agreements. Speaker [[John Boehner]] supported the measure, but many Republicans felt that the move gave too much power to Democrats and President Obama, specifically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherman|first=Jake|title=Jason Chaffetz strips Meadows of subcommittee chairmanship|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/chaffetz-strips-meadows-of-subcommittee-chairmanship-119252.html|work=Politico|date=20 June 2015|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref> This action was seen as controversial with many prominent Republican politicians, including Texas Senator [[Ted Cruz]], speaking out against the punishment.\n\nOn July 28, 2015, Meadows filed a [[motion to vacate the chair]] in order to force [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[John Boehner]] from his leadership position. The action was widely seen as an escalation of the feud between a faction of conservatives and the GOP leadership. Conservatives long have urged a coup against Mr. Boehner, who they view as too eager to make deals with Democrats and unwilling to go to the mat fighting for conservative principles.<ref>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/28/john-boehner-coup-mark-meadows-files-motion-oust-h/</ref>\n\n;Budget\nMeadows is a [[fiscal conservative]] and is part of a group that has advocated for a [[balanced budget amendment]] to the United States Constitution.  In addition he opposed the recent federal stimulus spending and has expressed desire for the federal spending growth rate to be capped at the inflation rate. He supports a moratorium on all earmarks until the budget has been balanced.

He has proposed that the United States should tap into oil and gas reserves to keep energy prices low, and to develop energy independence.

He opposes any federal funding for abortion and believes parents should be notified of underage abortion procedures. He also opposes churches and other religious sites providing birth control options.<ref name=issues/>\n\n;Gay marriage\nMeadows opposes [[same-sex marriage]].
