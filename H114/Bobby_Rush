He has since won consecutive re-election. The district was located principally on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], with a population from 2003 to early 2013 that was 65% [[African-American]], a higher proportion than any other [[congressional district]] in the nation. In 2011 the [[Illinois General Assembly]] redistricted this area following the 2010 census. While still [[minority-majority]], since early 2013 it is 51.3% African American, 9.8% Latino and 2% Asian. It re-elected Rush in 2014.\n\nA member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Rush is distinguished as the only politician to have defeated [[Barack Obama]] in an election, which he did in the [[Illinois's 1st congressional district election, 2000|2000 Democratic primary for Illinois' 1st congressional district]]. A civil rights activist during the 1960s, Rush became radicalized for a period and founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]].\n\n==Early life, education, and activism==\nRush was born on November 23, 1946 in [[Albany, Georgia]]. After his parents separated when Rush was 7 years old, his mother took him and his siblings to [[Chicago, Illinois]], joining the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans out of the South in the first part of the 20th century.<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=AAPL0151&DataType=AFHC&WinType=Free|title=Facts On File|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Rush dropped out of high school before graduating; he joined the [[U.S. Army]]. While stationed in Chicago in 1966, he joined the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], which had helped obtain national civil rights legislation passed in 1964 and 1965. In 1968, he went [[AWOL]] from the Army and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]].

After co-founding the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]] in 1968, he served as its defense minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/bobby-l.-rush--IL-H|title=Bobby L.

In the early 1980s however, Chicago's political life was transformed by the ascendancy of U.S. Representative [[Harold Washington]], a noted orator and a charismatic figure who helped unite the city's African-American community. Washington was elected [[Mayor of Chicago]] in 1983, the first African American to hold the office.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} That same year, Rush was elected alderman from the Second Ward on Chicago's South Side. He was a part of the pro-[[Harold Washington]] faction on the Council during the \"[[Council Wars]]\" that began in 1983 following Washington's election as Mayor.
