CHA was established in 1947 and is charged with the oversight of federal elections and the day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Committee has the responsibility to ensure that the House of Representatives runs in an effective and efficient manner, which is vital as we work to meet the many challenges facing this great nation.  Most importantly, this committee has jurisdiction over the federal election process, and, as Chairman, Representative Miller has been committed to making certain the Committee enacts rules to ensure our nation continues to have open, free, and fair elections.\n\nUnder her leadership as Chairman, the U.S. House received consecutive \u201cclean\u201d audits, demonstrating her commitment to transparency and accountability. She also played a major role in advancing legislation to end the practice of using millions of dollars in taxpayer funding to host political party conventions and, instead, redirected that funding for pediatric research. Working with House officers,  she has helped to increase the availability of low-cost digital tools used by the House to improve the House\u2019s daily functions and reduce operating costs. She also oversaw the [http://cha.house.gov/press-release/house-administration-reviews-voting-process-bauer-ginsberg-commission-recommendations Committee\u2019s review of the report generated by the Bauer-Ginsberg Commission], which focused on utilizing good, local governance over elections and made recommendations on different ideas to help locals election administrators improve upon their own voting processes.<ref name=\"Full Biography\"/>\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Committee on Homeland Security]]'''\n** [[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security|Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security]]\nRepresentative Miller has served on the [http://homeland.house.gov/ House Committee on Homeland Security] since March 2008.  Representative Miller is currently serving as Vice Chair of the full House Committee on Homeland Security and served as Chairman of the [http://homeland.house.gov/subcommittee-BMS Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security] from 2011 until February 2016.  She is also serving as a member of the [http://homeland.house.gov/subcommittee-CTI Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence].\n\nThe federal government\u2019s first and foremost responsibility is to provide for our national defense, and our common defense begins with a secure homeland.  The Committee is charged with oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ensuring its primary focus remains on the protection of the American people.\n\nAs Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, Representative Miller exercised effective oversight and initiated legislative efforts to ensure our nation\u2019s borders are adequately secured against international terrorist organizations, illegal immigration, drug and human smuggling, as well as the exploitation of the legitimate visa process.\n\nDuring the 113th Congress, Representative Miller championed legislation to formally authorize Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and clarify the security mission of the agency for the first time since the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002. The legislation passed the House on July 28, 2014.  She has also long advocated for ways to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s ability to identify and stop terrorists with western passports, authoring legislation in that would allow DHS to suspend a country\u2019s participation in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program if it fails to provide the U.S. with pertinent traveler information related to terror threats. Additionally, Representative Miller crafted legislation to increase oversight over the maritime security mission of DHS, as well as strengthen maritime security at home and abroad as we trade with our trusted partners.\n\nIn the 114th Congress, Representative Miller continued to push needed legislation that helped ensure we implement strong protections for our borders and global supply chain.  Our nation\u2019s borders can and must be secured, and her goal has been to see that DHS is making progress to confront the threats of terrorism, cyber terrorism, and mismanagement of the Department in these areas vital to our national security, and continuing to work towards a secure border and a safer homeland.\n\nMichigan\u2019s 10th Congressional District is a border district.  It is home to the Blue Water Bridge, which is the second-busiest border crossing on the northern tier; Selfridge Air National Guard Base, which has expanding missions in the area of homeland security; Coast Guard stations at Selfridge, Port Huron, and Harbor Beach; it borders Chemical Valley, which is one of the largest collections of petro-chemical operations in North America; the CN Rail Tunnel, which is the busiest rail artery in the U.S.; and is the genesis of important trade arteries, interstates I-94 and I-69.\n\nMiller has focused her efforts on building a stronger presence of homeland security assets at Selfridge, enhancing the security of our airways, roadways, railways, and waterways, in addition to securing our food and water supplies by enhancing Northern Border security.\n\nThe Committee on Homeland Security was established in 2002 to provide congressional oversight for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and better protect the American people against a possible terrorist attack.  Many of the programs at Selfridge and the armed service reserves throughout the 10th Congressional District fall under the purview of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  The Committee on Homeland Security provides oversight for the department and handles issues dealing with transportation security, border and port security, critical infrastructure protection, cyber security, and science and technology, emergency preparedness, emerging threats, intelligence and information sharing, investigations, and management and procurement.<ref name=\"Full Biography\"/><ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]]'''\n** [[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Highways and Transit|Subcommittee on Highways and Transit]]\n** [[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials|Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials]]\n** [[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment|Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment]]\nIn 2007, Representative Miller was appointed to the full [http://transportation.house.gov/ House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure].

Representative Miller is the only member from Michigan serving on this Committee and takes seriously the need to advocate on behalf of Michigan to ensure the state is returned its fair share of tax dollars for many infrastructure needs.  She believes all avenues of transportation, whether on land or on the sea, are important to improve, maintain, and support surrounding economic growth.\n\nMichigan\u2019s 10th Congressional District is host to the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, which is the second most traveled border crossing in North America.  It is a vital component of economic expansion not just for the district, but for the region, state, and nation.  This Committee allows her to offer enhanced oversight and influence to ensure this portal and others like it receive the federal attention they need and deserve.\n\nIn 2014, Representative Miller was appointed to the House Committee on Transportation and [http://candicemiller.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-special-panel-releases-final-report-on-p3s Infrastructure\u2019s Public-Private Partnership Special Panel.]  This panel was created to examine the current state of public-private partnerships (P3s) across all modes of transportation, economic development, public buildings, water, and maritime infrastructure and equipment, and make recommendations on balancing the needs of the public and private sectors when considering, developing, and implementing P3 projects to finance the Nation\u2019s infrastructure. As the only Michigan Member, her involvement was critical in examining innovative ways that P3s can benefit infrastructure projects in Michigan, such as the expansion of the Customs and Border Plaza at the Blue Water Bridge.\n\nThe Committee also holds jurisdiction over water quality issues. Throughout her career in public service, protecting the Great Lakes has been one of Representative Miller\u2019s principal advocacies.  She is a vocal proponent of policy designed to preserve and protect Michigan\u2019s most cherished natural resource.  During the 113th Congress, as the only member of the Committee from the state of Michigan, Miller tirelessly advocated for the Great Lakes during House and conference negotiations of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) and secured the inclusion of her provision designating all ports and harbors on the Great Lakes as a single, comprehensive navigation system for budgeting purposes \u2013 the Great Lakes Navigation System \u2013 essentially allowing the Great Lakes ports and harbors to create a unified front when it comes to federal funding.\n\nThe Committee has jurisdiction over all modes of transportation: aviation, maritime and waterborne transportation, highways, bridges, mass transit, and railroads.  The Committee also has jurisdiction over other aspects of our national infrastructure, such as clean water and waste water management, the transport of resources by pipeline, flood damage reduction, the management of federally owned real estate and public buildings, the development of economically depressed rural and urban areas, disaster preparedness and response, and hazardous materials transportation.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s broad oversight portfolio includes many federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Coast Guard, Amtrak, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the General Services Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and others.<ref name=\"Full Biography\"/>\n\n===Caucus memberships===\n* [http://www.nemw.org/policy-outreach/great-lakes-task-forces/?el_mcal_month=2&el_mcal_year=1941 Great Lakes Task Force] (Co-Chair)\n* [http://www.nmma.org/government/getinvolved/boatingcaucus.aspx Congressional Boating Caucus] (Co-Chair) Waterways Caucus\n* [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]]\n* Jobs Now Caucus (Co-Chair)\n* Sportsmen's Caucus\n* [[Congressional Caucus on Macedonia and Macedonian Americans]] (Co-Chair)\n\nFor the 110th Congress Miller was appointed to continue her service on the [[House Armed Services Committee]] and was added to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over not only surface transportation but also water quality issues related to the Great Lakes.

Representative Miller saw Representative Smith's no vote on the board and she \"didn't like the way that he voted.\" Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: \"Is this how you're going to vote; or, This is how you're going to vote?

Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote on the Medicare legislation.\n\nRepresentative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote.

The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the [[Michigan Thumb|Thumb]]. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in [[Mount Clemens]] to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the [[governor of Michigan]] rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a \"[[Hubert Humphrey]] Democrat\", and Miller called herself a \"[[George W. Bush]] Republican.\" She outraised Marlinga, and secured the [[Teamsters Union]] (but not [[AFL-CIO]]) endorsement.<ref name=Barone_2010>{{cite book\n |last1= Barone |first1= Michael |authorlink1= Michael Barone (pundit) |last2= McCutcheon |first2=Chuck |authorlink2= Chuck McCutcheon |title=[[The Almanac of American Politics]] |year=2010 |publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]], [[National Journal Group]], and Atlantic Media Company |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-226-03807-0 |pages=848\u2013850\n |lccn=2011929193}}</ref>\n\n===2006===\nMiller faced no opposition in the Republican primary, and was [[Acclamation|acclaimed]] as the Republican candidate on August 8, 2006.
