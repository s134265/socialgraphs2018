He faced no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent in the general election and won with 93% of the vote against an independent. He won re-election in 2000 with 81%--the only time he faced a Republican challenger.  He was unopposed for reelection from 2002 to 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=44761|title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - Mark Pocan|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter a redistricting by the Republican-controlled legislature, the 78th Assembly District boundaries were changed. Pocan was succeeded in the Assembly by Democrat [[Brett Hulsey]], who had previously represented the 77th District. (As in the 2010 race, the only serious challenge to the Democratic candidate was a Green candidate, Jonathan Dedering; the Republicans did not even field a candidate.)<ref>[http://gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/County%20by%20County_11.6.12%20Gen%20Election_Assembly.pdf \"2012 PRESIDENTIAL AND GENERAL ELECTION: G.A.B.
