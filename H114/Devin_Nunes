He is the second member of Congress to attend Tulare Union, three decades after Olympic gold medalist [[Bob Mathias]], who served in the House from 1967 to 1975. After associate's work at [[College of the Sequoias]], Nunes graduated from [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]], where he received a bachelor's degree in agricultural business and a master's degree in agriculture.\n\nIn 2009 Nunes wrote in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that he became an entrepreneur at 14 years old, when he bought seven head of young cattle, learning quickly how to profit from his investment. \"I had cracked open my piggy bank to buy seven head of young cattle to raise and sell,\" Nunes wrote. \"I had two choices: I could buy feed or I could fix fences in exchange for free grazing.

He unseated an 18-year incumbent on the Board of Trustees of his ''alma mater'', the College of the Sequoias, earning 65% of the vote.<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/candidate/devin-g-nunes/</ref> He served as a trustee from 1996 to 2002.<ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/nj_20021109_41.php</ref> In 2001, he was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] to serve as California State Director for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s Rural Development section. He left this post later that year to run for the Republican nomination in the 21st congressional district, a new district created through [[reapportionment]] after the [[2000 United States census]]. Before 2002, what is now the 21st district was part of three districts, represented by [[Bill Thomas]], [[Cal Dooley]], and [[George Radanovich]].\n\n== Elections 2002\u20132014 ==\n\nNunes' principal opponents in the seven-way 2002 Republican primary were [[List of mayors of Fresno, California|former Fresno mayor]] [[Jim Patterson (politician)|Jim Patterson]] and [[California State Assembly|state Assemblyman]] [[Mike Briggs (politician)|Mike Briggs]]. Nunes was the only major candidate from Tulare County, while Patterson and Briggs were both from Fresno. This was critical; 42% of the district's population was in Fresno County and 58% in Tulare County.<ref name=\"nj\">http://www.nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2008/people/ca/rep_ca21.htm</ref> Patterson and Briggs split the Fresno County vote, allowing Nunes to win by a four-point margin over Patterson, his nearest competitor. Nunes won 46.5% of the vote in Tulare County and 28.1% of the vote in Fresno County. Nunes was also helped by a strong showing in the rural part of the district.<ref>[http://primary2002.sos.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/2154.htm CA Secretary of State - Vote2002 - United States Congress District 21 - Tulare County<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He won the endorsement of the California Farm Bureau and the ''Fresno Bee''.<ref name=\"nj\"/> The district is solidly Republican, and Nunes coasted to victory in November.

With redistricting, Nunes lost most of eastern Tulare County to the neighboring 23rd District. [[California's 22nd congressional district|The 22nd]] also has an Hispanic plurality (44.8%). Based on recent election totals, it remains predominately Republican. In the 2012 and 2014 elections, Nunes won 61.88% and 70.58% respectively against Democratic opposition.<ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/member/373</ref>\n\n== U.S. Congress ==\n\n=== Committees ===\n\nDuring the [[108th United States Congress|108th Congress]], his first term, Nunes served on the [[United States House Committee on Resources|House Resources Committee]] where he was chairman of its National Parks Subcommittee. He was also a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States House Committee on Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] committees. In the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]], Nunes was named to the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]. In January 2013, Nunes was named chairman of the Ways and Means Trade subcommittee.<ref>[http://www.thebusinessjournal.com/news/government-and-politics/4608-nunes-to-chair-subcommittee-on-trade Nunes to chair subcommittee on trade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was also a member of the [[House Budget Committee]] during the 111th Congress. For the [[112th United States Congress]], Nunes was named to the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]. He was named chairman in the 114th Congress by Speaker [[John Boehner]].\n\nIn 2003, Nunes became a founding member of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]], a caucus of Republican Members of Congress of Hispanic and Portuguese descent.\n\n=== Tax Reform ===\n\nOn January 13, 2016, Nunes introduced the American Business Competitiveness Act (H.R. 4377), also known as the ABC Act. It would significantly lower taxes on American businesses, regardless of size or legal organization, by lowering federal tax rates on business income to 25% or less, allowing businesses to write off all expenses in a current calendar year, eliminate all business tax loopholes and special provisions in the U.S. tax code, and establish a territorial tax system that would remove penalties U.S. businesses face when returning foreign earnings (repatriation) and reinvesting them in the United States. The Tax and Heritage Foundations forecast significant employment gains and economic growth from the Act.<ref>http://nunes.house.gov/legislation/tax-reform.htm</ref><ref name=\"bna.com\">http://www.bna.com/nunes-bill-seen-n73014445591/</ref> The tax foundation also forecast a loss of $881 billion in federal revenue over a decade.<ref>http://www.bna.com/nunes-bill-seen-n73014445591</ref> Bloomberg BNA reported that Nunes' [[consumption tax]] model found in the ABC Act was influential in the drafting of the House Republican Tax Plan introduced by Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] and Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Kevin Brady]] in June 2016.<ref name=\"bna.com\"/> [[Douglas Holtz-Eakin]] told Bloomberg BNA of Nunes' work on tax reform, \u201cI think he deserves a lot of credit for someone who is not the chairman for having a tremendous impact on the debate.\u201d<ref name=\"bna.com\"/>\n\n=== Water ===\n\nOn May 1, 2011, with the support of other members of the San Joaquin Valley's Republican Congressional Delegation, Nunes authored the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act]] to stop a project designed to restore a dried-up section the [[San Joaquin River]]. This later became the basis for another bill co-sponsored by Nunes, the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act]], which passed the House of Representatives in February 2014 but was not voted on by the Senate. Nunes co-sponsored a third water bill, the [[California Emergency Drought Relief Act]], which also passed the House of Representatives in December 2014 but was also not voted on by the Senate. Water restrictions have been in place to enforce the [[Endangered Species Act]] and other environmental regulations that have seen water allocations decline dramatically even in non-drought years. The result has been what Nunes terms a \"man-made drought\".<ref>http://www.kmjnow.com/pages/landing_news?Valley-GOP-Reps-Introduce-Water-Legislat=1&blockID=520842&feedID=806</ref> Nunes wrote in [[National Review]] in April 2015, \"The House of Representatives has passed three bills in the last three years that would have expanded California water supplies by rolling back damaging environmental regulations. These bills died amid opposition from Senate Democrats, Governor Brown, and President Obama.\"<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\">http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416918/no-farmers-dont-use-80-percent-californias-water-devin-nunes</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, during a [[2012-2014 North American drought|drought]] that had hit California, Nunes rejected any link between the drought and [[global warming]], saying \"Global warming is nonsense.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Onishi|first1=Norimitsu|last2=Davenport|first2=Coral|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/us/politics/obama-to-announce-aid-for-drought-racked-california.html|title=Obama Announces Aid for Drought-Stricken California|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}</ref> He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of California\u2019s system of water irrigation and storage and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon and the delta smelt. \u201cThere was plenty of water.

At the time California farmers were criticized for using most of California's water, making the state's drought worse. The agriculture sector uses at least 80 percent of the state's water, often on water-intensive crops such as almonds. Nunes, a third-generation dairy farmer, challenged media criticism of the agriculture industry. He claimed, \"Farmers do not use 80 percent of California\u2019s water. In reality, 50 percent of the water that is captured by the state\u2019s dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and other infrastructure is diverted for environmental causes. Farmers, in fact, use 40 percent of the water supply. Environmentalists have manufactured the 80 percent statistic by deliberately excluding environmental diversions from their calculations.\"\n<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\"/> Nunes added that California's lack of adequate water storage facilities has only made the problem worse. He wrote, \"Furthermore, in many years there are additional millions of acre-feet of water that are simply flushed into the ocean due to a lack of storage capacity \u2014 a situation partly explained by environmental groups\u2019 opposition to new water-storage projects.<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\"/> Returning to an argument he has made before regarding California's water storage and irrigation system, Nunes added, \"The drought is a genuine problem in California, but our irrigation system was designed to withstand five years of drought.\"<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\"/>\n\n=== National security, foreign affairs and trade ===\n\nNunes is a vocal critic of the Obama administration\u2019s national security policies, calling for stronger measures, for example, to fight [[ISIS]], support for Ukraine and other Eastern European countries threatened by Russian actions in the region, and efforts to stop Iran\u2019s development of nuclear weapons.<ref>http://nunes.house.gov/podcasts/</ref> Nunes is also a prominent critic of the administration\u2019s response to the [[Benghazi]] terror attack, Nunes was instrumental in bringing three security officers who fought in Benghazi to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. His actions were recorded in remarkable detail by the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', including controversies within the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] (HPSCI) over the Benghazi investigations.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hayes|first1=Stephen F.|last2=Joscelyn|first2=Thomas|title=The Benghazi Report|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/benghazi-report_820665.html?page=3|accessdate=May 16, 2015|newspaper=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=December 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs chairman of the HPSCI, Nunes has oversight over some 17 military and national intelligence programs, including the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and other agency clandestine activities. Nunes travels extensively, like other HPSCI chairmen and members, and often to dangerous and strife-torn parts of the world. However, in the security sensitive and secretive world of intelligence, little is often disclosed in advance where HPSCI members travel to protect their safety, unless reported by HPSCI members themselves, the U.S or foreign governments, or international media.\n\nIn June 2015, Nunes attracted national and world media attention, when he said on an CBS' ''[[Face the Nation]]'', \"We face the highest threat level we have ever faced in this country, today. Even after 9/11.<ref>{{cite news|last1=CBS Face the Nation|title=Intel Chairman: Facing highest threat level in years|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=79&v=t3DiWfN-My0|accessdate=July 10, 2015|date=June 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen Paul Ryan replaced John Boehner as Speaker of the House of Representatives, the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee was vacated by Ryan. This set the stage for a committee leadership contest, where Nunes, holding a senior position on the committee, was mentioned as a replacement for Ryan. While Nunes' claim to the committee gavel was strong, he was asked by Ryan to remain chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Ryan said of Nunes, \u201cThe world has gotten only more dangerous, and serious times call for serious leaders. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked Rep. Devin Nunes to stay on as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\" <ref>{{cite news|last=Nunes |first=Devin |title=Nunes to Remain as Intel Committee Chairman |url=https://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/nunes-remain-intel-committee-chairman |accessdate=December 8, 2015 |publisher=[[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] |date=October 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210202433/https://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/nunes-remain-intel-committee-chairman |archivedate=December 10, 2015 |df= }}</ref> Reflecting on the fact that it was not an easy decision to remove himself from consideration for the powerful chairmanship of Ways and Means, Nunes said, \u201cAfter careful reflection and in light of the Speaker\u2019s wish for me to continue this important role, I have decided to remain Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\u201d <ref>{{cite news|last1=Gehrke|first1=Joel|last2=Plott|first2=Elaina|title=Devin Nunes Won\u2019t Seek Ways and Means Gavel, at Ryan\u2019s Request|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/426322/devin-nunes-wont-seek-ways-and-means-gavel-ryans-request-joel-gehrke-elaina-plott|accessdate=December 8, 2015|work=[[National Review]]|date=October 29, 2015}}</ref> Nunes' decision to remain as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in response to a personal appeal from Ryan for him to stay can be interpreted as the high confidence the House leadership has in Nunes as chairman, in addition to his closeness to Ryan over the years, which Nunes referenced in his book (see Author section below), ''[[Restoring the Republic]]'' (pp.&nbsp;62\u201363).\n\nAs co-chair of the Brazil and Mexico caucuses, Nunes was selected by Speaker [[John Boehner]] to be a member of a well-publicized congressional delegation that the Speaker led to Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico in January 2012. Members of the delegation were Reps. [[Dave Camp]] (R-MI), [[Ways and Means Committee]] chairman; [[Doc Hastings]] (R-WA), [[Natural Resources Committee]] chairman; [[John Kline (politician)|John Kline]] (R-MN), [[Education and the Workforce Committee]] chairman; [[Greg Walden]] (R-OR); and [[Dan Boren]] (D-OK). Boren was the sole Democrat on the trip.\n\nAs co-chair with [[Jared Polis]] (D-CO) of the [[U.S.-Mexico Friendship Caucus]], Nunes along with members of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]] of the House of Representatives met with President [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] of Mexico on April 24, 2012, in what is believed to be Calder\u00f3n's final trip to Washington, D.C, as President of Mexico. [[Steny Hoyer]], the Democratic Whip, also attended the meeting.<ref>http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/2012/04/se-reune-el-presidente-calderon-con-legisladores-estadounidenses/</ref>\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nIn 2006, Nunes authored the \"American-Made Energy Freedom Act\". In July 2008, the Republican Conference introduced the American Energy Act, which included a key Nunes proposal from the American-Made Energy Freedom Act to establish a renewable energy trust fund from revenues generated by deep ocean and Arctic coastal plain exploration and invest the monies in alternative fuels and technology.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-5890 American-Made Energy Freedom Act of 2006 (2006; 109th Congress H.R. 5890) - GovTrack.us<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 5899, \"A Roadmap for America's Energy Future\". It accelerates the exploration and production of fossil fuel; supports the rapid development of market-based alternative energy supplies; and expands the number of nuclear reactors from the current 104 to 300 over the next 30 years.<ref>http://nunes.house.gov/_files/NUNES_038_xml.pdf</ref> [[Kimberley Strassel]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that \"It's a bill designed to produce energy, not restrict it. It returns government to the role of energy facilitator, not energy boss. It costs nothing and contains no freebies. It instead offers a competitive twist to government support of renewable energy.\"<ref>http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748703578104575397652539348486.html</ref>\n\n=== Federal spending, healthcare and state pensions ===\n\nOn January 27, 2010, Nunes became an original cosponsor of H.R. 4529, \"A Roadmap for America's Future\", sponsored by Paul Ryan.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/user/RepDevinNunes#p/u/1/j5i9fHP7Wzo RepDevinNunes - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> H.R. 4529 proposes major reforms of the U.S. health care system, Social Security, the federal tax code, job training, and the budget process. The \"Roadmap\" claims to solve the problem of the unfunded liabilities of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and provides for their long-term financial solvency. With respect to Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the plan would increase costs for States or those States would reduce enrollment; with respect to Medicare, the CBO has said the average senior would pay nearly twice what they currently contribute for the same coverage when the plan is fully implemented. On January 29, 2010, President Obama said that the \"Roadmap\" is a \"legitimate\" plan to solve the fiscal crisis facing the United States due to the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Medicaid.<ref>http://devinnunes.blogspot.com/2010/01/obama-admits-roadmap-reform-is.html</ref> Nunes was also a cosponsor of \"Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2008\", an earlier version of H.R. 4529.\n\nAlso in 2009, Nunes coauthored the \"Patients' Choice Act\" with [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] (R-WI) in the House, and [[Tom Coburn]] (R-OK) and [[Richard Burr]] (R-NC) in the Senate. The Patient's Choice Act would establish a system of state [[health insurance exchange]]s and amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. The bill also proposes to adsorb Medicaid programs to the exchange system.<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h2520ih.txt.pdf FDsys - Browse Congressional Bills<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Patients' Choice Act was incorporated into A Roadmap for America's Future.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 6484, the \"Public Employee Pension Transparency Act\".<ref>http://nunes.house.gov/_files/BILLS111hr6484ih.pdf</ref> Paul Ryan and [[Darrell Issa]] (R-CA) are cosponsors. H.R. 6484 enhances transparency for state and local pensions, and would establish a clear federal prohibition on any future public pension bailouts by the federal government.\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n[[California State Route 99]] is a highway running north and south that breaks off from [[Interstate 5]] at [[Wheeler Ridge]] in [[Kern County]] and continues through the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] until it connects with I-5 again at [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]] in [[Tehama County]]. In 2005, Nunes introduced H.R. 99, which designated State Route 99 as a congressional [[High Priority Corridor]]. The bill also provided federal authorization for Highway 99 to become part of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The bill became law as part of H.R. 3 in August 2005. On February 17, 2011, Nunes introduced H.R. 761, the \"San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act\", which would give the State of California the option to redirect federal high-speed rail funds to finance improvements to Highway 99.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-761 San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act of 2011 (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 761) - GovTrack.us<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> H.R. 761 was cosponsored by [[Jeff Denham]] (R-CA) and [[House Majority Whip]] [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] (R-CA).<ref>http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/economy/x1248562259/McCarthy-backs-plan-to-redirect-bullet-train-money-to-improve-Highway-99</ref>\n\n=== Veterans ===\n\nThe Hubbard Act of 2008, H.R.5825, was named in honor of the Hubbard brothers of California, Jared, Nathan, and Jason. Jared and Nathan lost their lives serving in Iraq. Jason Hubbard was discharged as a sole survivor, but denied separation benefits on leaving the Army. The Hubbard Act provides sole survivors a number of benefits already offered to other soldiers honorably discharged. Sole survivors also do not have to repay any portion of their enlistment bonus, are entitled to the educational benefits of the Montgomery GI Bill, and can receive separation pay and transitional healthcare coverage.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nNunes has been characterized by his opponents as confrontational and sharp-tongued.<ref>[http://www.modbee.com/2009/07/14/781955/lawmakers-get-testy-in-water-debate.html Lawmakers get testy in water debate | Turlock Recent News | Modesto Bee<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has been an unrelenting critic of the American left, particularly San Francisco Bay Area liberal activists and the environmental lobby.<ref>http://nunes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=245399</ref> He wrote in his book that members of the environmental lobby were \"followers of neo-Marxist, socialist, Maoist or Communist ideals\".<ref>http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/09/03/100130/california-lawmakers-new-book.html</ref> During the debate over President Obama's health care bill in the House of Representatives, Nunes said of then-Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]], \"For most of the 20th century people fled the ghost of communist dictators and now you are bringing the ghosts back into this chamber.\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auJ4VtdAd7w</ref> He has also had a long-running dispute with another San Francisco Bay Area Democrat, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], over California water policy and other issues,<ref>[http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=161659 Nunes contemplating bid against Feinstein | news10.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> even running a series of advertisements against her in California.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/news/ap/politics/2011/Nov/07/gop_congressman_runs_tv_ads_attacking_feinstein.html RealClearPolitics - Politics - Nov 07, 2011 - GOP congressman runs TV ads attacking Feinstein<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This fueled media speculation, later denied, that Nunes would challenge her for the Senate.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/11/07/129562/nunes-staffer-says-congressman.html Nunes staffer says congressman won't challenge Feinstein | Politics | McClatchy DC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has said of Feinstein, \"She is either held hostage by extremists or she is an extremist.\"<ref>http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2011/11/will-nunes-has-started-running.html</ref> Nunes wrote in April 2015 of \"environmental extremists\" and the damage he charges they have done in pursuit of an environmental utopia: \"Utterly convinced of the righteousness of their crusade, environmental extremists stop at nothing in pursuing their utopian conception of 'sustainability.' The interests of families, farmers, and entire communities \u2014 whose very existence is often regarded as an impediment to sustainability \u2014 are ignored and derided in the quest for an ever-more pristine environment free from human contamination.\"<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\"/>\n\nNunes has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy, calling it a \"complete disaster\". He has also called Obama administration officials \"wimps\" for opposing enhanced interrogation techniques but using drones to attack terrorists. \"People complain about harsh interrogation yet are okay with vaporizing people. In reality, they are kind of wimps, because they are not willing to do the hard stuff of capturing and interrogating people to get actionable information. The enemy knows that this administration won't interrogate them,\" Nunes told the ''[[American Thinker]]''.<ref>[http://www.americanthinker.com/2013/01/a_tale_of_three_cabinet_nominees.html Articles: A Tale of Three Cabinet Nominees<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNunes' criticisms are not limited to liberals or the Obama administration. During the October 2013 budget standoff, Nunes famously called certain members of his own [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Conference]] who favored a government shutdown \"lemmings with suicide vests\". \"It's kind of an insult to lemmings to call them lemmings\" because of their tactics, he said.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/30/nunes-calls-fellow-house-republicans-lemmings-with-suicide-vests/ Nunes calls fellow House Republicans \u2018Lemmings with suicide vests\u2019 - The Washington Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/conservatives-with-a-cause-were-right.html?hp</ref><ref>[http://www.salon.com/2013/09/30/gop_civil_war_rages_on/singleton/ GOP civil war rages on - Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nunes explained the origin of his remarks, and the climate in the House GOP Conference and floor in an interview and panel discussion on CNN, during the government shutdown, which he posted on his YouTube channel on October 5, 2013.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGZuqhgrTG4 |'Congressman Devin Nunes appears on CNN with Jake Tapper to discuss the government shutdown. CNN Government Shutdown Special - Congressman Devin Nunes'</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, Nunes came under fire when he charged that Michigan Congressman and fellow Republican [[Justin Amash]] was \"[[al-Qaeda]]'s best friend in Congress\" because of Amash's voting record on [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) surveillance. At the time, Amash had voted in opposition to a Nunes water bill for California \"on constitutional grounds.\" Nunes' statement linked the two issues, adding that Amash was acting as an ally of San Francisco liberals, who were opponents of Nunes' California water bills and NSA policies: \u201cHe\u2019s been leading the charge and not telling the truth about [NSA surveillance policies]. He\u2019s been fanning the flames, and it gets to the point where my assessment is this is a guy willing to work with San Francisco Democrats to protect bait fish, and at the same time he\u2019s Al Qaeda\u2019s best friend in the Congress.\u201d<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/establishment-tea-partier-106476.html Establishment takes on die-hard tea partier</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, during debate over Department of Homeland Security funding, Nunes again gave sharp and colorful criticism, this time of certain conservative members of the Republican Conference: \"I prefer to be in the arena voting than trying to placate a small group of phony conservative members who have no credible policy proposals and no political strategy to stop Obama\u2019s lawlessness. While conservative leaders are trying to move the ball up the field, these other members sit in exotic places like basements of Mexican restaurants and upper levels of House office buildings, seemingly unaware that they can\u2019t advance conservatism by playing fantasy football with their voting cards.\"<ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/republicans-we-ve-got-no-plans-to-oust-boehner-20150228</ref>\n\n== Lajes Air Base ==\n\nNunes has placed himself firmly in the middle of negotiations between the U.S. and Portuguese governments over the future of [[Lajes Air Base]] on the island of [[Terceira]] in the [[Azores]]. Since 2009, the Obama administration has had plans to reduce U.S. personnel at the air base, but has encountered strong opposition from the Portuguese government for a host of reasons, including future costs to the host government. Nunes, believing he is acting in U.S. interests, has blocked the Pentagon from implementing the plan. There are 650 military personnel and family members at the base. The Pentagon plan would reduce that number to some 150. Nunes' plans for the Azores would actually increase U.S. personnel. He is also proposing relocating Africa Command and European Command intelligence centers to the Azores, also contrary to plans by Pentagon and NATO to create a larger intelligence \"fusion\" facility in Britain. Nunes' plan would locate 1,000 intelligence personnel to the Azores. He maintains that this would save the U.S. money because cost of living and construction costs are less in the Azores than the U.K.<ref>Barnes, Julian E.(June 16, 2015) \"U.S., Portugal Wrangle Over Fate of U.S. Base in Azores,\" ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.

The result was to make relocating personnel near London appear cheaper than the Azores. Nunes has called the Pentagon cost estimates \"laughable.\" He remarked, when asked about the congressional investigation, \"You have the nicest base that you have in all of the Department of Defense, with cheaper annual costs on the cost of living, the housing allowance, not to mention the size and scope of the base. It was built to house 2,000 airmen. With Croughton you would have to build or rent this housing out.\"\n\nThe negative strategic implications of U.S. withdrawals from Lajes have been pointed out by [[Gordon G. Chang]] and [[Michael Rubin]]. Rubin, in a November 2015 article in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', wrote that the primary beneficiary of Obama administration policy could be the Chinese, who, as Gordon Chang reported in 2012, were showing high level interest in the Azores, and Lajes, which would give them a vital strategic foothold in the Atlantic.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Michael|title=Don\u2019t Give China an Atlantic Base|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/asia/china/dont-give-china-an-atlantic-base/|accessdate=December 9, 2015|work=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]|date=November 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Author ==\n\nOn September 13, 2010, Nunes' book, ''Restoring the Republic: A Clear, Concise, and Colorful Blueprint for America's Future,'' was published by [[WND Books]], an imprint of [[WorldNetDaily]]. He also wrote a foreword to the bestselling 1951 novel ''Home Is An Island'' by Portuguese-American author Alfred Lewis. Nunes' foreword is in the 2012 edition by Tagus Press, an imprint of the Center for Portuguese Culture and Studies at the [[University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth]]. In it, Nunes writes about the experience of Azoreans immigrating to America: \"Lewis\u2019 classic book remains relevant today. ''Home Is An Island'' says a lot about America and immigrants in the early twentieth century, and how they decided to come to America. It describes in countless ways how Azoreans viewed themselves as Americans long before they left the Azores.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Portuguese in the Americas Series|url=http://www.portstudies.umassd.edu/pas/home_in_an_island.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Committees 112th Congress ===\n\n*'''[[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]'''\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]]'''\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade|Subcommittee on Trade]]\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]]\n\n=== Committees 114th Congress ===\n*'''[[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]''' - Chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intelligence.house.gov/about/hpsci-majority-members |title=HPSCI Majority Members |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nNunes is married to Elizabeth Nunes (n\u00e9e Tamariz), with whom he has three daughters\u2014Evelyn, Julia, and Margaret.<ref name=\"gpo.gov\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.nunes.house.gov/ Congressman Devin Nunes] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.devinnunes.net/ Devin Nunes for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/California/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Devin_Nunes_%5BR-22%5D}}\n{{CongLinks| congbio = n000181 | ballot = Devin_Nunes | nndb = 080/000039960 | votesmart = 16725 | govtrack = 400297 | opencong = 400297 | fec = H8CA20059 | opensecrets = N00007248 | assets = devin-nunes | legistorm = 400/Rep_Devin_Nunes_CA.html | followthemoney = | ontheissues = CA/Devin_Nunes.htm | congress = devin-nunes/1710 | worldcat = | cspan = 1003553 | imdb = 3615654 | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = gIQAt1EGAP }}\n*[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Devin_Nunes Profile] at [[SourceWatch]]\n*[http://www.smartvoter.org/2002/11/05/ca/state/race/usrep21/ Smart Voter's election results for 2002], [http://www.smartvoter.org/2004/11/02/ca/state/race/usrep21/ 2004], [http://www.smartvoter.org/2006/11/07/ca/state/race/usrep21/ 2006]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Bill Thomas]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[California's 21st congressional district]]|years=2003\u20132013}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[David Valadao]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[California's 22nd congressional district]]|years=2013\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc|rows=2}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Chair of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]]|years=2015\u2013present}}\n|-\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Timothy F.
