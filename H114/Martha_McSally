General [[Tommy Franks]], then commander of the [[United States Central Command]] (USCENTCOM), announced in 2002 that U.S. military servicewomen would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be \"encouraged\" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman, Colonel Rick Thomas, said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been \"under review\" before the lawsuit was filed.
