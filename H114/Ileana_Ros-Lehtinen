She appeared in a British documentary, which was  entitled ''[[638 Ways to Kill Castro]]'', saying: \"I welcome the opportunity of having anyone assassinate Fidel Castro and any leader who is oppressing the people.\" After a 28-second clip began circulating on the Internet, she claimed the filmmakers spliced clips together to get the sound bite. Twenty-four hours after the controversy erupted, director Dollan Cannell sent unedited tapes of his interview with Ros-Lehtinen to reporters.<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/12/23/220652.shtml?s=ic \"Rep.

In a Winter 2013 interview with the [[Human Rights Campaign]], she stated that her support for same-sex marriage was based on \"coming from Cuba, losing my homeland to communism, seeing the state control everything\u2014I\u2019m a person that believes in individual liberties and not having the government control everything.\u201d When asked about her support for her son [[Rodrigo Lehtinen|Rodrigo]], a transgender LGBT rights advocate, Ros-Lehtinen commented that: <blockquote>It\u2019s important for families to support their children and to support their children\u2019s choices. It\u2019s important to listen to your children, accept your children and have your children know that you love them unconditionally.

I\u2019m right and everything else is wrong.\u201d And that\u2019s a lonely way to live.
