Murray]], an organizer for the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers Alliance]] (CFA), who was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] South Carolina Congressman in the 53rd and 54th U.S. Congresses in the late nineteenth century. He and other black politicians had strongly opposed the 1895 state constitution, which essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most African-American citizens, a situation that the state maintained for more than half a century until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nClyburn graduated from Mather Academy (later named [[Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy]]) in [[Camden, South Carolina]], then attended South Carolina State College (now [[South Carolina State University]]), a [[historically black college]] in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]].

He served in this position until 1992, when he stepped down to run for Congress.\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n===Elections===\nFollowing the 1990 census South Carolina's district lines were redrawn. Due to prior racial discrimination before the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] required the 6th district, which had previously included the northeastern portion of the state, to be redrawn as a [[black-majority district]]. Before this ruling, African Americans were a minority in all six of South Carolina's districts.\n\n;1992\u20132006\nThe reconfigured 6th stretched across most of South Carolina's [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]], but swept south to include most of the black precincts around Charleston and west to include most of the black precincts around Columbia, including Clyburn's home.  Five-term incumbent [[Robin Tallon]]'s home in [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] was in the district, but he chose to retire. Five candidates, all of whom were African American, ran for the Democratic Party nomination for the seat.  As this district was heavily Democratic, the primary was understood to be the real contest.\n\nClyburn secured 55% of the vote in the primary, eliminating the need for an expected run-off.  As expected, he won the general [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|election in November]] handily.

The departing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran for the Minority Leader position in order to remain the House party leader, while Clyburn announced that he would challenge [[Steny Hoyer]], the second-ranking Democrat in the House and the outgoing Majority Leader, for the Minority Whip post. Clyburn had the support of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], which wanted to keep an African-American in the House leadership, while Hoyer had 35 public endorsements, including three standing committee chairs.

The plan is to deepen the ports to allow for larger commercial ships to arrive from the Panama Canal which is currently being expanded to allow for larger ships to pass through.
