The district is located in [[West Texas]] and includes [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]], [[Brownwood, Texas|Brownwood]] and [[Granbury, Texas|Granbury]].\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nConaway was born in [[Borger, Texas|Borger]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]] northeast of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]. He graduated in 1966 from [[Permian High School]] in [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]] in [[Ector County, Texas|Ector County]], where he was a standout player for the Permian Panthers and a member of the first Permian State Championship team in 1965. After High School, he attended [[Texas A&M University-Commerce]] (then named East Texas State University), lettering in Football for the Lions from 1966-1969 and was a member of two [[Lone Star Conference]] championship teams.

Bush]].\n\nSoon after Bush was elected [[governor of Texas]], he appointed Conaway to the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy, which regulates accountancy in Texas. He served on the board as a volunteer for seven years, the last five as chairman.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Committee on Agriculture]]''' (Chairman)\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Armed Services]]'''\n** [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]]\n** [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities|Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities]]\n* '''[[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]'''\n\n===Caucus memberships===\n* CPA Caucus (Founder)\n* [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]]\n* Reliable Energy Caucus\n* Sportsmen's Caucus\n\n===Tenure===\nIn 2006, Conaway voted against extending the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/49935/mike-conaway/13/civil-liberties-and-civil-rights</ref><ref>http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20131224-aides-to-texans-on-capitol-hill-alter-bosses-wikipedia-entries.ece</ref>\n\n==Party leadership==\nIn January 2007, Conaway began chairing the three-member audit committee for the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. By January 28, 2008, Conaway had uncovered a fraud, where hundreds of thousands of dollars were missing from NRCC bank accounts, and supposed annual audits on the NRCC books had actually not been performed since 2001.<ref>[http://archive.is/XAMdr  Suzanne Gamboa, \"Texas lawmaker uncovers GOP committee fraud\", Associated Press, published by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (March 13, 2008).]</ref>\n\nConaway is one of the few [[Certified Public Accountant]]s in Congress.\n\n==Political campaigns==\nConaway first ran for elective office in 2003, when he ran in a special election for the 19th Congressional District, which came open after 18-year Republican incumbent [[Larry Combest]] stepped down shortly after winning a 10th term. Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican [[Randy Neugebauer]]. A few months later, the [[Texas Legislature]] [[2003 Texas redistricting|redrew the state's districts]] in an effort engineered by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in part because [[Texas House]] Speaker [[Tom Craddick]] was from that area. This district is heavily Republican&nbsp;\u2013 by some accounts, the most Republican district in Texas.  Republican candidates usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area ([[Glasscock County]] had voted 93 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced no major-party opposition in 2008.\n\nConaway endorsed former [[Massachusetts]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] for president in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nConaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014.
