However, he is known to be pragmatic on certain issues. For example, he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote in favor of the reauthorization of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) in the 110th Congress.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll1009.xml</ref> Simpson has also been a supporter of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding.

Simpson has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club who claim the bill lacks \"wilderness values\"<ref name=\"idaho.sierraclub.org\">http://idaho.sierraclub.org/sawtooth/issues/CIEDRA/index.html</ref> because the bill allows for motorized access to certain portions of the wilderness area and some land federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3603</ref> Simpson has also faced opposition from groups who oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly because of restricted access to wilderness areas.<ref name=\"idaho.sierraclub.org\"/> In August 2015 a revised version of CIEDRA, the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act, passed Congress and was signed by President Obama, creating the [[Hemingway\u2013Boulders Wilderness|Hemingway\u2013Boulders]], [[Jim McClure\u2013Jerry Peak Wilderness|Jim McClure\u2013Jerry Peak]], and [[White Clouds Wilderness|White Clouds]] wilderness areas, which cover a total of {{convert|275665|acre|ha}} of central Idaho.<ref>{{cite news|first=Rich |last=Landers |title=Obama signs Boulder-White Clouds Wilderness Bill |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |date=August 7, 2015 |url=http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/outdoors/2015/aug/07/obama-signs-boulder-white-clouds-wilderness-bill/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ac7HrrFv?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spokesman.com%2Fblogs%2Foutdoors%2F2015%2Faug%2F07%2Fobama-signs-boulder-white-clouds-wilderness-bill%2F |archivedate=August 7, 2015 |accessdate=August 7, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Judgeship reorganization===\nHe also played a crucial role with the [[Ninth Circuit]] Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maplight.org/map/us/bill/11026/default/history |title=Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2007 \u2013 Vote: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. &#124; History and Status &#124; MAPLight.org \u2013 Money and Politics |publisher=MAPLight.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-23 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Mike Simpson's goal is to amend [[title 28]], and create the appointment of additional [[Federal Circuit]] Judges, to divide the [[Ninth Judicial Circuit]] into two smaller judicial circuits.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-162&tab=committees</ref> The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act was introduced to House Judiciary Committee, and more specifically to the subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. Since Jan 24, 2011, the bill has been in the subcommittee, where it will be refined before being presented by to the Judiciary Committee, then later the actual House of Representatives.\n\n===Health===\nFollowing the death of Congressman [[Charlie Norwood]] (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading advocate of the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry. The advocacy inspired Simpson to introduce legislation regarding [[methamphetamine]], specifically how the drug affects tooth decay or \"[[methmouth]]\". The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the [[oral health]] problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], make grants available to educate 12- to 17-year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to [[oral health]] and the provision of dental care.<ref>See http://www.house.gov/list/press/id02_simpson/meth_mouth.html</ref> As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] to the [[Subcommittee on Health]] where it has been debated, but never brought to a conclusion. As soon as that happens, it will be brought up before the whole committee, then later the House of Representatives.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1671</ref>\n\nSimpson was an original co-sponsor of the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded [[newborn screening|screening of newborns]] and children for heritable disorders.<ref name=cbo1281>{{cite web|title=CBO \u2013 H.R. 1281|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45434|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that \"the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth.

Roybal-Allard|accessdate=24 June 2014|date=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Energy===\nSimpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of [[nuclear power]], extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. Simpson's support for this form of energy plays a significant role in his membership of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development]], which oversees the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], a main site for nuclear and [[alternative energy]] research in the United States.\n\n===Other===\nSimpson is a strong supporter of the domestic [[sugar beet]] producers,<ref>[http://www.sugaralliance.org/newsroom/reps-melancon-and-simpson-named-house-sugar-caucus-chairs.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and the Idaho potato growers.<ref>See http://www.mcclatchydc.com/244/story/35363.html</ref> In 2010, Simpson took up the cause, alongside his former Democratic colleague, [[Walt Minnick]], the lead sponsor of the bill, to secure a third federal judge for Idaho.<ref name=\"idahoreporter.com\">http://www.idahoreporter.com/2010/minnick-and-simpson-working-on-getting-idaho-a-third-federal-judge/</ref>  Simpson was quoted as saying, \"The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho\u2019s district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states.\"<ref name=\"idahoreporter.com\"/>\n\nSimpson has become increasing opposed to President Obama and the Congressional Democrats' policy agenda.  Simpson has announced his commitment to repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness.<ref>''See'' http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/article_66f4c33a-43ff-11df-aaa4-001cc4c002e0.html</ref>  He is said to be close to and loyal to Speaker [[John Boehner]].<ref>Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan (20 December 2012), [http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/john-boehners-plan-b-toughest-hour-85391_Page2.html Boehner\u2019s toughest hour] ''[[Politico]]''</ref>\n\n==Public recognition==\n''[[Esquire magazine]]'' listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008.<ref name=\"esquire1\">{{cite web|last=David |first=Elliott |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-endorsements-2008/10-best-members-congress-text?click=main_sr |title=10 Best Members of Congress \u2013 Election 2008 |publisher=Esquire |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The magazine said of Simpson, \"More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground...\"<ref name=\"esquire1\"/> The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in a quote by [[Henry Clay]]: \"Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively.\" This quote is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office.<ref>See http://www.hcn.org/issues/338/16795</ref>\n\nSimpson has been credited as having a key role in the election of [[John Boehner]] (R-OH) to the position of [[House Majority Leader]] in the [[109th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/207/story/14316.html |title=Ties to House leader pay off for Simpson, Idaho &#124; Dan Popkey's reporting and columns |publisher=Idaho Statesman |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the [[Speaker Pro Tempore]] of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order.  This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] (R-IL) as a joke.  When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Mr. Simpson began once again to serve frequently as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House.\n\nHe has been supported by a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, which helps pragmatic Republicans who are willing to work across party lines.<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nSimpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by [[Mike Crapo]], who was running for [[United States Senate]]. He defeated former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Richard H. Stallings]] in the general election. Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 Simpson defeated former Democratic state representative [[Jim D. Hansen]], son of former Republican Congressman [[Orval H.
