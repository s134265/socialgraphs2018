Previously, he served in the California Legislature representing [[California's 7th State Senate district]] from 2008 to 2015. From 2006 to 2008, DeSaulnier represented [[California's 11th State Assembly district]]. He also served as a Contra Costa County supervisor (district 4, 1994\u20132006) and on the Concord City Council (1991\u20131994).\n\nIn March 2009, DeSaulnier announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in the special election for the [[California's 10th congressional district special election, 2009|10th congressional district]] after the resignation of the incumbent [[Ellen Tauscher]]. DeSaulnier received endorsements from Congresswoman Tauscher and Congressman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] for the seat.   In the September 1 primary election, DeSaulnier came in second, after [[John Garamendi]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nBorn in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], DeSaulnier earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[History]] from the [[College of the Holy Cross]]. He traveled cross-country to California in the early 1970s and eventually settled in Concord.  As a young man, DeSaulnier worked as a probation officer, a truck driver and a hotel services employee.  DeSaulnier was a member of both the Teamsters International Union and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. His jobs allowed his early exposure to the challenges of working families and the power of organized labor to create equity among employers and employees. A small businessman, DeSaulnier owned and operated several restaurants in the greater Bay Area before taking office in the Legislature in 2006.  He is a member of the Concord Chamber of Commerce and the Contra Costa Council.  DeSaulnier lives in Concord where he raised his two adult sons, Tristan and Tucker. He is an avid runner and has completed twenty-one marathons.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n== Local government ==\n\nDeSaulnier was appointed to the Concord Planning Commission in 1988.  In 1991, he was elected to the Concord City Council and served as mayor of Concord in 1993.  He was also a member of the [[University of California]] Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program Advisory Committee.\n\nIn early 1994, Republican Governor [[Pete Wilson]] appointed DeSaulnier, then a fellow Republican, to the [[Contra Costa County]] Board of Supervisors district 4, filling a vacancy caused by the resignation of Supervisor [[Sunne McPeak]].<ref>Erin Hallissy, \"McPeak's Successor Appointed: Concord Mayor to Join Contra Costa Board,\" ''San Francisco Chronicle'', January 29, 1994, p. A17.</ref>  DeSaulnier served on the Board of Supervisors until 2006. He was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998 and 2002.  In June 1998, he received 98.4 percent of the vote against write-in candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca-contracostacounty.civicplus.com/depart/elect/old/frame29.htm |title=Election Results Frame |publisher=Ca-contracostacounty.civicplus.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref>  In March 2002, he retained his seat with 79 percent of the vote against challenger Dione Mustard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.markdesaulnier.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=158 |title=Mark DeSaulnier \u2013 Publication Details |publisher=Cms.markdesaulnier.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027065934/http://cms.markdesaulnier.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=158 |archivedate=October 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Board of Supervisors is a non-partisan office, DeSaulnier was active in Republican party affairs during much of his tenure as county supervisor. In September 1998, for example, he donated $200.00 to the United Republican Finance Committee of the Contra Costa County Republican Central Committee, thereby aiding [[Dan Lungren]] (R) in the gubernatorial race against [[Gray Davis]] (D), [[Matt Fong]] (R) in his U.S. Senate race against Sen. [[Barbara Boxer]] (D), [[Charles Ball]] (R) in his congressional race against Rep. [[Ellen Tauscher]] (D), and [[Allen Payton]] (R) in his Assembly race against Assemblyman [[Tom Torlakson]] (D).<ref>See Federal Election Commission Disclosure Database: {{cite web|url=http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?99034200516 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502132810/http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?99034200516 |archivedate=May 2, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref> Many of the candidates that DeSaulnier aided supported the anti-union Proposition 226 on the June 1998 statewide ballot.\n\nDuring DeSaulnier's tenure on the Board of Supervisors, he sponsored the Industrial Safety Ordinance and the Refinery Flare Rule for local refineries and chemical facilities. DeSaulnier served on the executive boards of the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. He was appointed to represent the Bay Area on the California Air Resources Board by the Air District (1997\u20132006).\n\nAs a member of the Air Resources Board, DeSaulnier supported strong environmental regulations, including cleaner-burning gasoline, lower-emission vehicles (LEVs), the identification of diesel exhaust as a toxic air contaminant, dioxin monitoring in the Bay Area, the banning of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline, the identification of secondhand smoke as a carcinogen, the reduction of emissions from dairy farms, the phase-out of rice straw in the central valley and the reduction of emissions from cruise ships.\n\nOn a county level, DeSaulnier introduced a Women's Health Program to serve the health-care needs of all women in Contra Costa County.  He also established the annual Children and Families' Budget, a separate County budget that reviews and measures the effectiveness of County programs in these areas. His other projects for children include AfterSchool4All, the Future Fund and the Children and Families Committee of the Board of Supervisors.\n\nThe [[Contra Costa Times]] editorial board was critical of DeSaulnier's record as county supervisor.  An editorial published in 2009 stated, \"Many of the financial problems that afflict Contra Costa County today stem directly from decisions DeSaulnier championed while he was supervisor. Most notably, in 2002, at a time when the county faced a $31.5 million shortfall, was already laying off workers and was already experiencing increased public employee pension costs, DeSaulnier supported unsustainable pension increases that hiked benefits for public safety workers by as much as 50 percent. The plan allowed public safety workers to retire at age 50 with a pension worth 3 percent of their salary for each year served. Such excessive public employee union benefits have strained some local jurisdictions to the brink of bankruptcy.\"<ref>''Contra Costa Times'', August 23, 2009: http://www.contracostatimes.com/opinion/ci_13193307</ref>\n\n== State Assembly ==\n\nIn the June 2006 Democratic primary, DeSaulnier carried 52 percent of the vote against [[Laura Canciamilla]] and two other opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primary2006.sos.ca.gov/Returns/stasm/1100.htm |title=CA Secretary of State \u2013 Primary Election- State Assembly District 11 \u2013 Districtwide |publisher=Primary2006.sos.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref>  DeSaulnier was endorsed by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.markdesaulnier.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=131 |title=Mark DeSaulnier \u2013 Publication Details |publisher=Cms.markdesaulnier.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023225144/http://cms.markdesaulnier.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=131 |archivedate=October 23, 2007 }}</ref> US Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] and California Senator [[Tom Torlakson]].

He received 98% of the vote in the June 2008 Democratic primary election against write-in candidates; former Assemblyman [[Joe Canciamilla]] initially was to challenge DeSaulnier for the Senate seat, but dropped out of the race.  In the 2008 general election, DeSaulnier received 66.6% of the vote against Republican Christian Amsberry.\n\nIn the Senate, DeSaulnier is the chair of the Labor and Industrial Relations committee, and a member of the Health, Transportation and Housing, and Appropriations committees.
