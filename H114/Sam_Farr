The bill maintains that the vice president purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States (1) by fabricating a threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and (2) about an alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda in order to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against the nation of Iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests and (3) that Cheney has openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States. (see http://congress.gov for more details on H.Res. 333)\n\n\"Many residents in the Central Coast support the removal of Cheney from office, and I am proud to represent their values in Congress,\" Farr said in a brief statement.<ref>[http://www.montereyherald.com/ci_6355617?nclick_check=1]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nOn July 30, 2007, Farr received the Senator David Pryor Special Achievement Award for his ongoing advocacy for communities with military bases presented by the Association of Defense Communities.
