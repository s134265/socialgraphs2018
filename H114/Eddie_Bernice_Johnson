She has been serving as a representative since 1993, when she was the first registered nurse elected to the U.S. Congress, and was re-elected in 2016. She formerly served in the Texas state house, where she was elected in 1972 in a landslide, the first black woman to win electoral office from [[Dallas, Texas]]. She also served for more than one term in the Texas senate before being elected to Congress.\n\nJohnson had a career in nursing before entering politics. She served for 16 years as the first African-American Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital.\n\n== Early life, education, and medical career ==\n\nBorn and reared in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]], Johnson grew up wanting to work in medicine. She left Texas, which had segregated schools, and attended [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]], where she received a diploma in nursing in 1956. She transferred to [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], from which she received a bachelor's degree in nursing. She later attended [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|title=JOHNSON, Eddie Bernice, (1935 - )|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000126|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nJohnson was the first African American to serve as Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital.

More African Americans began to run for office and be elected.\n\nIn 1972, as an underdog candidate running for a seat in the [[Texas House of Representatives|Texas House]], Eddie Bernice Johnson won a landslide victory.

She was the first woman and the first African American from the Dallas area to hold this office since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Her particular concerns included health care, education, [[public housing]], racial equity, [[economic development]], and job expansion. Johnson served on the Finance Committee, for which she chaired the subcommittee on Health and Human Services, and on the Education Committee. She wrote legislation to regulate diagnostic radiology centers, require drug testing in hospitals, prohibit discrimination against [[AIDS]] victims, improve access to health care for AIDS patients, and prohibit hospital kickbacks to doctors. As a [[Housing discrimination (United States)|fair housing]] advocate, she sponsored a bill to empower city governments to repair substandard housing at the expense of landlords, and wrote a bill to enforce prohibitions against housing discrimination.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fair housing bill proposed|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w5M9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6TUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6922,6217253&dq=eddie-bernice-johnson+fair+housing&hl=en|newspaper=The Bonham Daily Favorite|date=December 22, 1988}}</ref>\n\nJohnson worked against racism, while dealing with discrimination in the legislature. \"Being a woman and being black is perhaps a double handicap,\" she told the ''Chicago Tribune.'' \"When you see who's in the important huddles, who's making the important decisions, it's men.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Korosec|first=Thomas|title=Eyes On Texas: Where Men Are Men And Women Run For Public Office|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-08-19/features/9003090294_1_lone-star-state-texans-men-and-women/2|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 19, 1990}}</ref> Johnson sponsored several bills aimed towards equity, including a bill to establish goals for the state to do business with 'socially-disadvantaged' businesses. She crafted a fair housing act aimed at toughening up fair housing laws and establishing a commission to investigate complaints of [[housing discrimination (United States)|discriminatory housing practices]].\n\nJohnson also held committee hearings and investigated complaints. In 1989, she testified in a federal court about racism in the Dallas city government. In 1992, she formally asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to investigate harassment of local black students. That same year, she held hearings to examine discrimination charges about unfair contracting bids for the government's [[Superconducting Super Collider]].\n\nJohnson fears the legacy that discrimination leaves for youth. \"I am frightened to see young people who believe that a racist power structure is responsible for every negative thing that happens to them,\" she explained to the ''New York Times.'' \"After a point it does not matter whether these perceptions are true or false; it is the perceptions that matter.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Suro|first=Roberto|title=In Dallas, Race Is at the Heart Of City Politics|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/weekinreview/in-dallas-race-is-at-the-heart-of-city-politics.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 10, 1989}}</ref>\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n===Elections===\n\nMidway through her second term in the state senate, Johnson opted to run in the Democratic primary for the newly created [[Texas 30th congressional district]].

Vera]],'' she won re-election to a third term with 55% of the vote, the worst election performance of her congressional career. All of the candidates in the race appeared on a single ballot regardless of party, and Johnson faced two other Democrats.  Proving just how Democratic this district still was, the three Democrats tallied 73 percent of the vote among  them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30082 |title=TX District 30 Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}</ref>\n\nJohnson has never faced another contest nearly that close. She has been reelected nine more times with at least 72% of the vote. In 2012 Johnson easily beat two opponents in the Democratic Primary, State Representative Barbara Mallory Caraway and lawyer Taj Clayton, gaining 70% of the vote; she went on to win the general election by a landslide, gaining almost 79% of the votes cast.<ref>{{cite web|first=Elected Officials Directory|title=US House District 30|url=http://www.texastribune.org/directory/districts/us-house/30/|publisher=Texas Tribune|accessdate=5 June 2013}}</ref> She was re-elected in 2014 and 2016.\n\n===Tenure===\nThe 17th chair of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], Johnson opposed the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002|Iraq Resolution of 2002]]. During debate on the House floor, she stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"I am not convinced that giving the President the authority to launch a unilateral, first-strike attack on Iraq is the appropriate course of action at this time. While I believe that under international law and under the authority of our Constitution, the United States must maintain the option to act in its own self-defense, I strongly believe that the administration has not provided evidence of an imminent threat of attack on the United States that would justify a unilateral strike. I also believe that actions alone, without exhausting peaceful options, could seriously harm global support for our war on terrorism and distract our own resources from this cause.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=E.

She was the first African American and first woman in Congress to serve as Chair of this Subcommittee. As Subcommittee Chair, Johnson sponsored the [[Water Resources Development Act]]. She successfully secured and led Congress in overriding President Bush\u2019s veto of it.

After his withdrawal from the race, she pledged her support as a superdelegate to [[Barack Obama]]. Her district backed Obama heavily in the 2008 election.\n\nJohnson and Rep. Donna Edward (D) proposed a publicly funded park on the moon to mark where the [[Apollo mission]]s landed between 1969 and 1972. The Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, H.R. 2617, calls for the park to be run jointly by the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/309829-dems-propose-historical-park-on-the-moon], ''The Hill''</ref>\n\n====Scholarship violations====\n\nIn August 2010, Amy Goldson, counsel for the [[Congressional Black Caucus Foundation]], said that Johnson violated organizational rules by awarding scholarship money to four relatives of her own and two children of a top aide.

Johnson has been a strong advocate for the need to invest in [[STEM fields|science, technology, engineering and math]] (STEM) education. In April 2012, Johnson introduced the \"Broadening Participation in STEM Education Act.\u201d This would authorize the Director of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to award grants to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority groups receiving degrees in STEM.
