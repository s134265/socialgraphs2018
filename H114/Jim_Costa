Costa garnered support from this significant Lao- and Hmong-American community in California, in large part, because of his leadership and support for S. 200, \"The Lao Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill,\" co-introduced by Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] of Alaska, which would grant burial honors to Lao and Hmong Veterans of the U.S. Secret War in Laos.<ref>Doyle, Michael, McClatchy News (October 28, 2009) \"Hmong, Lao veterans seek burials in national cemeteries\", http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/10/28/77920/hmong-lao-veterans-seek-burials.html#.Ue86Em3c2E4#storylink=cpy</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-320483452.html \"Laos, Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill Introduced in U.S. Senate\"], ''China Weekly News'', February 19, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/nation/la-na-nn-hmong-soldier-cemeteries-20130206 \"Hmong soldiers who aided U.S. seek burial in national cemeteries\"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 6, 2013.</ref>\n\nEach year, the Fresno-based [[Lao Veterans of America]] and [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]] organize delegations from the Central Valley, and Rep.

Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state's Democratic Party establishment, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Dianne Feinstein]], endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] state senator [[Roy Ashburn]] in November.\n\nThe 20th district is a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave [[Al Gore]] his highest vote total outside the state's two large [[conurbation]]s ([[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the north and [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]] to the south).  Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn's campaign made plays on Costa's name, \"Costa's going to cost ya,\" and linked him to former Governor [[Gray Davis]], calling them \"two taxing twins\". Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn's 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican [[Kings County, California|Kings County]].\n\n;2006\nCosta ran unopposed for reelection in 2006. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources|Natural Resources Committee]]'s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]].\n\n;2008\nCosta was reelected in 2008 with 74 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area and Southern California.\n\n;2010\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2010#District 20}}\nCosta was challenged for reelection by Republican nominee [[Andy Vidak]].
