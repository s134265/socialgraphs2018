Recognizing the important role Turkey plays as the only Muslim Nation in NATO and having had many conversations with commanding generals of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Whitfield thought it was important to form a Congressional entity to provide support for Turkey in its role as a NATO Member.\n\nHe was one of three Republicans who voted for the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll009.xml#Y |format=PDF |title=YEAS 247 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>\n\nWhen chairman of the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]] within the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]], Whitfield held hearings on child pornography and during his tenure as Chairman of Energy and Power has chaired over 40 hearings on energy issues.  He has focused significant time and resources to inform the American people about President Obama's Clean Power Plan which was initiated by regulation through the EPA. President Obama and EPA did not consult or make any effort to work with Congress before issuing the Clean Power Plan to dictate the way electricity would be generated in the future. Chairman Whitfield referred to the Clean Power Plan as \"extreme\" and an \"unprecedented power grab\". At one of his hearings, Professor Lawrence Tribe, who teaches Constitutional Law at Harvard University said the Clean Power Plan if implemented, would be like tearing up the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court, in considering a petition filed by 27 States opposed to the Clean Power Plan issued an injunction to stop implementation of the Clean Power Plan. The DC Federal Court of Appeals is currently preparing to hear oral arguments on the Clean Power Plan.\n\n===Legislation sponsored===\nWhitfield introduced the [[Electricity Security and Affordability Act (H.R. 3826; 113th Congress)]] into the House on January 9, 2014.<ref name=3826sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3826 \u2013 Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3826|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would repeal a pending rule published by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) on January 8, 2014.<ref name=cbo3826>{{cite web|title=CBO \u2013 H.R. 3826|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45112|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> The proposed rule would establish uniform national limits on [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions from new [[Power station|electricity-generating facilities]] that use [[coal]] or [[natural gas]].<ref name=\"cbo3826\"/><ref name=HousevotesBlock>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House votes to block EPA regs on coal-fired electricity plants|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/200096-house-votes-to-block-epa-regs-on-electricity-plants|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=6 March 2014}}</ref> The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture]] and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]] technology.<ref name=\"cbo3826\"/> Whitfield said that, if finalized, the EPA's rule would \"make it impossible to build a new coal-powered plant in American... That is hard to believe that that will can be the situation in our great country, particularly since 40 percent of our electricity comes from coal.\"<ref name=\"HousevotesBlock\"/> Whitfield argued that the legislation was needed because the EPA refused to respond to criticism or complaints about their proposed rule.<ref name=\"HousevotesBlock\"/> He also introduced and managed the floor debate on two Congressioanl{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Review Acts that had passed the United States Senate to stop the Clean Energy Plan Regulations adopted by EPA. He was successful in passing both measures on the House Floor>\n\nWhitfield's major legislative accomplishments are creating the 170,000 acre of National Recreation Area at the Land between the Lakes. He also introduced and helped pass a health compensation program at the [[Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant]], which  paid over $315,000,000 to the 3,139 employees and victims of toxic contamination. He also helped create the first Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plan for seniors.\n\nWhitfield has introduced, sponsored and helped pass several bills to strengthen and insure the humane treatment of animals in the United States. He is a recognized leader regarding the humane treatment of animals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressman Ed Whitfield|url=http://whitfield.house.gov/about/biography|publisher=Whitfield.house.gov|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref> His major national accomplishment may have been the banning of U.S. horse slaughter for human consumption, with an amendment that barred the U.S. Department of Agriculture from spending money on inspections of horse slaughterhouses, which fed demand for horsemeat in some European and Asian countries. The ban is no longer in place, but it had the effect of killing the horse-slaughter industry in the U.S.\n\nWhitfield's legislation to prohibit the soring of Tennessee Walking Horses garnered the support of 311 House members and 57 Members of the United States Senate but was not brought to the floor of the House of Representatives because of an ethics complaint filed by individuals who sored horses . The individuals who filed the complaint had a total of 52 violations of the 1970 Horse Protection Act.  In July 2016, the House Ethics Committee reproved him for failing to prohibit lobbying contacts between his staff and Connie Harriman Whitfield, a lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States. Although the bill was introduced by Congressman Whitfield and had been a concern of his for many years, The Humane Society of the United  States supported the legislation and was a part of a coalition of over 75 entities working to adopt Whitfield's legislation.  The Ethics Committee issued a report stating that Whitfield's breach was unintentional.  Whitfield said the individuals who filed the Complaint had accomplished  their goal of stopping his legislation.<ref>https://irjci.blogspot.com/2016/07/ethics-panel-rebukes-congressman.html</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2010}}\nWhitfield had been a Democrat for most of his life, but in 1994 filed to run in the 1st District as a Republican. He defeated the 1992 Republican nominee, Steve Hamrick, in the primary, and then defeated freshman Democratic Congressman [[Thomas Barlow (politician)|Tom Barlow]] by 2,500 votes. He defeated Dennis Null in 1996 even as [[Bill Clinton]] carried the district, and hasn't faced a close race since. On September 29, 2015, Whitfield announced that he would not be seek re-election in 2016.Some of his critics said he did not seek re-election because of an Ethics complaint filed against him by a group opposed to his legislation to stop the soring of Tennessee walking Horses. That complaint was filed in 2013, and despite publicity throughout his district, Whitfield was re-elected overwhelmingly. He won every county in his District with the exception of Marion County. On August 31, 2016, Whitfield announced that he would resign, effective September 6, prompting a special election that would allow his successor to serve in any \"lame duck\" session of Congress after the Nov. 8 election.\n\n==Personal life==\nConnie Whitfield is the Congressman's second wife. She was a former Justice Department attorney, Assistant Secretary of Interior for Fish, Wildlife and National Parks in the George H.W. Bush Presidency. She was also a Director of the Export-Import Bank of the United States and was appointed Vice Chair of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission by Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher.
