The district had long been a Republican stronghold, but it had been significantly reconfigured. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] shifted heavily Republican [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]] and a mostly Republican section of [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] to the heavily Democratic [[Maryland's 8th congressional district|8th district]]. It shifted Republican-tilting sections of [[Harford County|Harford]] and [[Baltimore County|Baltimore]] counties into the already heavily Republican [[Maryland's 1st congressional district|1st district]].\n\nTaking their place was a heavily Democratic section of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]]. The shifts were quite controversial, as Republicans accused Democrats of shifting district boundaries in their favor, while Democrats, led by Governor [[Martin O'Malley]], insist the redrawn districts are fair and accurate representations of the state's population trends.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.carrollcountytimes.com/cct-arc-acca0c6c-9aa4-5159-b6ef-82eb618dd4a9-20120909-story.html|title=Officials, experts explain views on new districts|last1=Lake|first1=Brett|date=September 9, 2012|publisher=''Caroll County Times''|accessdate=August 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the primary, Delaney was endorsed by former President [[Bill Clinton]], U.S. Congresswoman [[Donna Edwards]], Comptroller [[Peter Franchot]], the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and the ''Gazette''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Pershing|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/delaney-md-democrats-work-to-show-unified-front-after-newcomers-primary-win/2012/04/04/gIQA6u0GvS_story.html|title=Delaney, Md.
