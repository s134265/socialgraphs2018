Henrique|OIH]]</small>, (born October 1, 1973) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|22}}, serving since 2003.  The district, numbered as the 21st District from 2003 to 2013, is located in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and includes most of western [[Tulare County]], as well as much of eastern [[Fresno County]]. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is also the author of the book ''Restoring the Republic'', published by [[WND]] Books in September 2010. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Nunes one of the rising stars of American politics under 40, in their list of \u203340 under 40\u2033; that is, the top forty civic leaders under 40 years of age.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023831_2023829_2025225,00.html Devin Nunes - 40 Under 40 - TIME<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nunes is a member of two committees in the House of Representatives, [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means]], where he is chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade and [[Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].<ref>[http://www.thebusinessjournal.com/government/7612-boehner-appoints-nunes-to-intelligence-committee US home prices rise strong 12.1 percent in June<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He is also co-chair of the [[Brazil Caucus]] and the [[U.S.-Mexico Friendship Caucus]].\n\n== Early life, education, and career ==\nNunes was born in [[Tulare, California]]. His family has operated a farm in Tulare County for three generations. The Nunes family is of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] descent, immigrating from the [[Azores]] to California.<ref>[http://thehill.com/capital-living/23845-i-broke-so-many-tractors-they-made-me-work-with-the-cows 'I broke so many tractors, they made me work with the cows' | TheHill<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNunes graduated from Tulare Union High School. He is the second member of Congress to attend Tulare Union, following Olympic gold medalist [[Bob Mathias]] three decades later, who served in House of Representatives from 1967 to 1975. After associate's work at [[College of the Sequoias]], Nunes graduated from [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]], where he received a bachelor's degree in agricultural business and a master's degree in agriculture.\n\nNunes was first elected to public office when he was 22 years old. He unseated an 18-year incumbent for a seat on the Board of Trustees of his ''alma mater'', the College of the Sequoias, earning 65 percent of the vote.<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/candidate/devin-g-nunes/</ref> He served as a trustee from 1996 to 2002.<ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/nj_20021109_41.php</ref> In 2001, he was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] to serve as California State Director for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s Rural Development section. He left this post later in the year to run for the Republican nomination in the 21st congressional district, a new California district created through [[reapportionment]] after the [[2000 United States census]]. Before 2002, the 21st congressional district was part of three districts represented respectively by [[Bill Thomas]], [[Cal Dooley]], and [[George Radanovich]].\n\n== Elections 2002\u20132010 ==\n\nNunes' principal opponents in the crowded seven-way 2002 Republican primary were [[List of mayors of Fresno, California|former Fresno mayor]] [[Jim Patterson (politician)|Jim Patterson]] and [[California State Assembly|state Assemblyman]] [[Mike Briggs (politician)|Mike Briggs]]. Nunes was the only major candidate from Tulare County, while Patterson and Briggs were both from Fresno. This was critical; 42% of the district's population was in Fresno County and 58% in Tulare County.<ref name=\"nj\">http://www.nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2008/people/ca/rep_ca21.htm</ref> Patterson and Briggs split the vote in Fresno County, allowing Nunes to win by a four-point margin over Patterson, his nearest competitor. Nunes won 46.5% of the vote in Tulare County and 28.1% of the vote in Fresno County. In addition to Patterson and Briggs splitting Fresno County's vote, Nunes was also helped by a strong showing in the rural part of the district.<ref>[http://primary2002.sos.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/2154.htm CA Secretary of State - Vote2002 - United States Congress District 21 - Tulare County<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He won the endorsement of the California Farm Bureau and the ''Fresno Bee''.<ref name=\"nj\"/> This district is solidly Republican, and Nunes coasted to victory in November. He has been reelected five times against only nominal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opposition. During the June 8, 2010, California primary, Nunes actually received more write-in votes in the Democratic primary than the Democratic write-in candidate.<ref>http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-primary/pdf/85-95-cd.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.co.fresno.ca.us/DepartmentPage.aspx?id=43518 County of Fresno - County Clerk Registrar of Voters - June 8, 2010 Statewide Direct Primary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He ran unopposed in the 2010 general election.\n\nNunes' district was renumbered as the 22nd District after the 2010 census.  It lost most of eastern Tulare County to the neighboring 23rd District, and became plurality-Hispanic.  However, it is no less Republican than its predecessor.\n\n== U.S. Congress ==\n\n=== Committees ===\n\nDuring [[108th United States Congress|108th Congress]], Nunes' first term in Congress, he served on the [[United States House Committee on Resources|House Resources Committee]], where he was chairman of its National Parks Subcommittee. He was also a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States House Committee on Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] committees. In the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]], Nunes was named to the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]. In January 2013, Nunes was named chairman of the Ways and Means Trade subcommittee.<ref>[http://www.thebusinessjournal.com/news/government-and-politics/4608-nunes-to-chair-subcommittee-on-trade Nunes to chair subcommittee on trade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was also a member of the [[House Budget Committee]] during the 111th Congress. For the [[112th United States Congress]], Nunes was named to the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].\n\nIn 2003, Nunes became a founding member of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]], a caucus of Republican Members of Congress of Hispanic and Portuguese descent.\n\n=== Policies and legislation ===\n\n==== Water ====\n\nOn May 1, 2011, Nunes with the other members of the San Joaquin Valley's Republican Congressional Delegation introduced the [[San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act]] to restore the flow of water to the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. Water restrictions have been in place to enforce the [[Endangered Species Act]], which has seen water allocations decline dramatically even in non-drought years. The result has been what Nunes terms a \"man-made drought\".<ref>http://www.kmjnow.com/pages/landing_news?Valley-GOP-Reps-Introduce-Water-Legislat=1&blockID=520842&feedID=806</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, during a [[2012-2014 North American drought|drought]] that had hit California, Nunes rejected any link between the drought and [[global warming]], saying \"Global warming is nonsense.\"  He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of California\u2019s system of water irrigation and storage, and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon. \u201cThere was plenty of water. This has nothing to do with drought.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Onishi|first=Norimitsu|title=Obama Announces Aid for Drought-Stricken California|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=14 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Onishi|first=Norimitsu|title=Obama Announces Aid for Drought-Stricken California|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/us/politics/obama-to-announce-aid-for-drought-racked-california.html?hpw&rref=us&_r=0|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=14 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Energy ====\n\nIn 2006, Nunes authored the \"American-Made Energy Freedom Act\". In July 2008, the Republican Conference introduced the American Energy Act, which included a key Nunes proposal from the American-Made Energy Freedom Act to establish a renewable energy trust fund from revenues generated by deep ocean and Arctic coastal plain exploration and invest the monies in alternative fuels and technology.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-5890 American-Made Energy Freedom Act of 2006 (2006; 109th Congress H.R. 5890) - GovTrack.us<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 5899, \"A Roadmap for America's Energy Future\". It accelerates the exploration and production of fossil fuel; supports the rapid development of market-based alternative energy supplies; and expands the number of nuclear reactors from the current 104 to 300 over the next 30 years.<ref>http://nunes.house.gov/_files/NUNES_038_xml.pdf</ref> [[Kimberley Strassel]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that \"It's a bill designed to produce energy, not restrict it. It returns government to the role of energy facilitator, not energy boss. It costs nothing and contains no freebies. It instead offers a competitive twist to government support of renewable energy.\"<ref>http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748703578104575397652539348486.html</ref>\n\n==== Federal spending, healthcare, state pensions ====\n\nOn January 27, 2010, Nunes became an original cosponsor of H.R. 4529, \"A Roadmap for America's Future\", sponsored by Paul Ryan.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/user/RepDevinNunes#p/u/1/j5i9fHP7Wzo RepDevinNunes - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> H.R. 4529 proposes major reforms of the U.S. health care system, Social Security, the federal tax code, job training, and the budget process. The \"Roadmap\" claims to solve the problem of the unfunded liabilities of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and provides for their long-term financial solvency. With respect to Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the plan would increase costs for States or those States would reduce enrollment; with respect to Medicare, the CBO has said the average senior would pay nearly twice what they currently contribute for the same coverage when the plan is fully implemented. On January 29, 2010, President Obama said that the \"Roadmap\" is a \"legitimate\" plan to solve the fiscal crisis facing the United States due to the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Medicaid.<ref>http://devinnunes.blogspot.com/2010/01/obama-admits-roadmap-reform-is.html</ref> Nunes was also a cosponsor of \"Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2008\", an earlier version of H.R. 4529.\n\nAlso in 2009, Nunes coauthored the \"Patients' Choice Act\" with [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] (R-WI) in the House, and [[Tom Coburn]] (R-OK) and [[Richard Burr]] (R-NC) in the Senate. The Patient's Choice Act would establish a system of state [[health insurance exchange]]s and amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. The bill also proposes to adsorb Medicaid programs to the exchange system.<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h2520ih.txt.pdf FDsys - Browse Congressional Bills<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Patients' Choice Act was incorporated into A Roadmap for America's Future.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 6484, the \"Public Employee Pension Transparency Act\".<ref>http://nunes.house.gov/_files/BILLS111hr6484ih.pdf</ref> Paul Ryan and [[Darrell Issa]] (R-CA) are cosponsors. H.R. 6484 enhances transparency for state and local pensions, and would establish a clear federal prohibition on any future public pension bailouts by the federal government.\n\n==== Transportation ====\n\n[[California State Route 99]] is a highway running north and south that breaks off from [[Interstate 5]] at [[Wheeler Ridge]] in [[Kern County]] and continues through the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] until it connects with I-5 again at [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]] in [[Tehama County]]. In 2005, Nunes introduced H.R. 99, which designated State Route 99 as a congressional [[High Priority Corridor]]. The bill also provided federal authorization for Highway 99 to become part of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The bill became law as part of H.R. 3 in August 2005. On February 17, 2011, Nunes introduced H.R. 761, the \"San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act\", which would give the State of California the option to redirect federal high-speed rail funds to finance improvements to Highway 99.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-761 San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act of 2011 (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 761) - GovTrack.us<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> H.R. 761 was cosponsored by [[Jeff Denham]] (R-CA) and [[House Majority Whip]] [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] (R-CA).<ref>http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/economy/x1248562259/McCarthy-backs-plan-to-redirect-bullet-train-money-to-improve-Highway-99</ref>\n\n==== Veterans ====\n\nThe Hubbard Act of 2008, H.R.5825, was named in honor of the Hubbard brothers of California, Jared, Nathan, and Jason. Jared and Nathan lost their lives serving in Iraq. Jason Hubbard was discharged as a sole survivor, but denied separation benefits on leaving the Army. The Hubbard Act provides sole survivors a number of benefits already offered to other soldiers honorably discharged. Sole survivors also do not have to repay any portion of their enlistment bonus, are entitled to the educational benefits of the Montgomery GI Bill, and can receive separation pay and transitional healthcare coverage.\n\n=== National security, foreign affairs, and trade ===\n\nAs a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Nunes would have oversight over 17 military and national intelligence programs, including the [[CIA]] and other clandestine activities. He appears to travel extensively as a committee member. Unlike most congressional travel, in the highly secretive world of intelligence little is disclosed where Members of Congress travel unless reported by the House intelligence committee, foreign governments, or international media. Committee records indicate that Nunes has traveled to [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Asia]] during 2011\u20132012.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/12/23/134023/job-of-a-lawmaker-includes-world.html Lawmakers spend millions on foreign travel to more than 120 countries | Politics | McClatchy DC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Foreign country news reports reveal that Nunes was in Kashmir in November 2011 with [[Mac Thornberry]] (R-TX) also a member of the House intelligence committee and vice-chairman of the [[House Armed Services Committee]], as part of a larger trip to [[India.]] It was further reported (and photographed) that they met with [[Kashmir]] Chief Minister, [[Omar Abdullah]].<ref>[http://www.kashmirmediawatch.com/jammu/us-codel-led-by-mac-thornbery-calls-on-omar US CODEL led by Mac Thornbery calls on Omar | Kashmir Media Watch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs co-chair of the Brazil and Mexico caucuses, Nunes was selected by Speaker [[John Boehner]] to be a member of a well-publicized congressional delegation that the Speaker led to Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico in January 2012. Members of the delegation were Reps. [[Dave Camp]] (R-MI), [[Ways and Means Committee]] chairman; [[Doc Hastings]] (R-WA), [[Natural Resources Committee]] chairman; [[John Kline (politician)|John Kline]] (R-MN), [[Education and the Workforce Committee]] chairman; [[Greg Walden]] (R-OR); and [[Dan Boren]] (D-OK). Boren was the sole Democrat on the trip.\n\nAs co-chair with [[Jared Polis]] (D-CO) of the [[U.S.-Mexico Friendship Caucus]], Nunes along with members of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]] of the House of Representatives met with President [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] of Mexico on April 24, 2012, in what is believed to be Calder\u00f3n's final trip to Washington, D.C, as President of Mexico. [[Steny Hoyer]], the Democratic Whip, also attended the meeting.<ref>http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/2012/04/se-reune-el-presidente-calderon-con-legisladores-estadounidenses/</ref>\n\n=== Controversies ===\nNunes has been referred to as brash and sharped-tongued by his opponents.<ref>[http://www.modbee.com/2009/07/14/781955/lawmakers-get-testy-in-water-debate.html Lawmakers get testy in water debate | Turlock Recent News | Modesto Bee<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has had a long-running dispute with Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] over water policy and other issues,<ref>[http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=161659 Nunes contemplating bid against Feinstein | news10.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> running a series of ads against her in California.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/news/ap/politics/2011/Nov/07/gop_congressman_runs_tv_ads_attacking_feinstein.html RealClearPolitics - Politics - Nov 07, 2011 - GOP congressman runs TV ads attacking Feinstein<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There was even speculation that Nunes would challenge her for the Senate.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/11/07/129562/nunes-staffer-says-congressman.html Nunes staffer says congressman won't challenge Feinstein | Politics | McClatchy DC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nunes has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy referring to it as a \"complete disaster\". He has also called Obama administration officials \"wimps' for being opposed to enhanced interrogation techniques but for using drones instead to deal with terrorists. \"People complain about harsh interrogation yet are okay with vaporizing people. In reality, they are kind of wimps, because they are not willing to do the hard stuff of capturing and interrogating people to get actionable information. The enemy knows that this administration won't interrogate them,\" Nunes told the [[American Thinker]].<ref>[http://www.americanthinker.com/2013/01/a_tale_of_three_cabinet_nominees.html Articles: A Tale of Three Cabinet Nominees<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDuring the October 2013 budget standoff, Representative Nunes called the leadership of his caucus \"Lemmings with suicide vests, it's kind of an insult to lemmings to call them lemmings\" because he expected his party would get most of the blame when the government shut down. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/30/nunes-calls-fellow-house-republicans-lemmings-with-suicide-vests/ Nunes calls fellow House Republicans \u2018Lemmings with suicide vests\u2019 - The Washington Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/conservatives-with-a-cause-were-right.html?hp</ref> <ref>[http://www.salon.com/2013/09/30/gop_civil_war_rages_on/singleton/ GOP civil war rages on - Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, Nunes came under fire when he made the charge that Congressman [[Justin Amash]] was \"[[al-Qaeda]]'s best friend in Congress\" due to Amash's voting record on war, foreign policy, and civil liberties.<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/establishment-tea-partier-106476.html Establishment takes on die-hard tea partier</ref>\n\n=== Author ===\n\nOn September 13, 2010, Nunes' book, ''Restoring the Republic: A Clear, Concise, and Colorful Blueprint for America's Future'' was published by [[WND Books]], an imprint of [[WorldNetDaily]].\n\n=== Committees 112th Congress ===\n\n*'''[[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]'''\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]]'''\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade|Subcommittee on Trade]]\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]]\n\n=== Committees 113th Congress ===\n*'''[[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]''' - Chairman.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/boehner-taps-devin-nunes-to-head-house-intelligence-panel/article/2556343 |title=Boehner taps Devin Nunes to head House Intelligence panel |last1=Ferrechio |first1=Susan |date=18 November 2014 |website=www.washingtonexaminer.com |publisher=Washington Examiner |accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.nunes.house.gov/ Congressman Devin Nunes] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.devinnunes.net/ Devin Nunes for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/California/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Devin_Nunes_%5BR-22%5D}}\n*{{CongLinks| congbio = n000181 | ballot = Devin_Nunes | nndb = 080/000039960 | votesmart = 16725 | govtrack = 400297 | opencong = 400297 | fec = H8CA20059 | opensecrets = N00007248 | assets = devin-nunes | legistorm = 400/Rep_Devin_Nunes_CA.html | followthemoney = | ontheissues = CA/Devin_Nunes.htm | congress = devin-nunes/1710 | worldcat = | cspan = 1003553 | imdb = 3615654 | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = gIQAt1EGAP }}\n*[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Devin_Nunes Profile] at [[SourceWatch]]\n*[http://www.smartvoter.org/2002/11/05/ca/state/race/usrep21/ Smart Voter's election results for 2002], [http://www.smartvoter.org/2004/11/02/ca/state/race/usrep21/ 2004], [http://www.smartvoter.org/2006/11/07/ca/state/race/usrep21/ 2006]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Bill Thomas]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[California's 21st congressional district]]|years=2003\u20132013}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[David Valadao]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[California's 22nd congressional district]]|years=2013\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc|rows=2}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Chairperson of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]]<br>{{small|Designate}}|years=2015\u2013present}}\n|-\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Timothy F.
