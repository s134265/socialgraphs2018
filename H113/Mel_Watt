He won the four-way Democratic primary--the real contest in this heavily Democratic district--with 47 percent of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=270846</ref>  He then easily won [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|the general election]] by defeating Barbara Gore Washington ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) and Curtis Wade Krumel ([[Libertarian Party (United States)|L]]) with 70 percent of the vote, becoming the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Charlotte since 1953.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28268</ref>  In 1993, the original version of his district was thrown out in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]],'' and was reconfigured to exclude its far western and far eastern portions.  The new 12th, however, was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Watt was reelected 10 more times.  He only faced one relatively close race, when Republican Scott Keadle held him to 55 percent in 1998.\n\nWatt was arguably the most liberal member of North Carolina's congressional delegation, and one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent the state.

After the meeting, Nader alleged that Watt twice uttered an \"obscene racial epithet\" towards him. It was alleged that Watt said: \"You're just another arrogant white man &mdash; telling us what we can do &mdash; it's all about your ego &mdash; another fucking arrogant white man.\" Although Nader (who is of Lebanese descent) wrote a letter to the Caucus and to Watt asking for an apology, none was offered.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nader Angers Congressional Black Caucus with Demand for Apology|newspaper=The Hill|date=14 July 2004|author=Nichols, Hans|author2=Savodnik, Peter |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0714-11.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to Federal Reserve auditing===\nIn 2009, fellow congressman [[Ron Paul]] reported to Bloomberg that while Paul's bill [[HR 1207]], which mandates an audit of the [[Federal Reserve]], was in subcommittee, Watt had substantially altered the substance of the bill, a move which had \"gutted\" the bill's protections.<ref name=\"bloomberg fed\">{{cite news|last=Ivry|first=Bob|title=Federal Reserve Policy Audit Legislation \u2018Gutted,\u2019 Paul Says|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=atc2o1ijLRno|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=30 October 2009}}</ref> According to Bloomberg News, on October 20, 2009, \"The bill, with 308 co-sponsors, has been stripped of provisions that would remove Fed exemptions from audits of transactions with foreign central banks, monetary policy deliberations, transactions made under the direction of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) and communications between the Board, the reserve banks and staff, Paul said today.\" Paul said there is \"nothing left\" in the bill after Watt's actions.<ref name=\"bloomberg fed\"/>\n\nPaul responded when he and [[Alan Grayson]] of [[Florida]] passed a competing amendment hours before the bill cleared the [[House Financial Services Committee]] to restore the bill's original language and undo Watt's attempts to weaken its effects. Watt won support from Chairman [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]] and the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], both of which backed his amendment. Eight of the ten Black Caucus members on the committee voted against the Paul-Grayson amendment. Watt and Frank voted to inhibit the bill's approval.
