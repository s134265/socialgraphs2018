The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program.

In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service to the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006 he returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service.  Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again.
