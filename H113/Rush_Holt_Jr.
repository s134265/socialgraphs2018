When it comes to global warming, for instance, Representative Holt says we don't need people in Congress who understand atmospheric pressure, or glaciation. We simply need them to be open to the idea that evidence might disprove what they think they know. And that, he says, is thinking like a scientist.\"<ref name=\"Thinking Like a Scientist: Solution to Politics?\">{{cite web|last=Holt|first=Rush|title=Thinking Like a Scientist: Solution to Politics?|url=http://www.rushholt.com/content/thinking-scientist-solution-politics|publisher=Congressman Rush Holt|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n;Education\nCo-Chair of the [[Research and Development Caucus]], a member of the [[House Committee on Education and Labor]], and serving on the [[National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century]], Holt has worked on crafting several comprehensive education policies.
