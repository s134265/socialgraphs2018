He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is based in [[Knoxville]].\n\n==Early life, education, and legal career==\nDuncan was born in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. His \"paternal grandparents were small farmers in [[Scott County, Tennessee|Scott County]], which in 1861 left Tennessee, refusing to follow the Volunteer State into the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and declared itself 'the Free and Independent [[state of Scott]].'\"<ref name=Kauffman>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]] (2005-09-12) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/sep/12/00011/ Volunteer Statesman], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Duncan's parents were Lois (Swisher) and [[John Duncan, Sr.]], who \"hitchhiked into [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] with five dollars in his pocket,' and after an education at the [[University of Tennessee]] was elected mayor of Knoxville and then congressman.\"<ref name=Kauffman/> The elder Duncan was also a co-owner of the [[Tennessee Smokies|Knoxville Smokies]] of the \"[[Southern League (baseball)|Sally League]],\" for which his son \"was a batboy, a ball shagger, scoreboard operator, and, as a freshman at the University of Tennessee, the Smokies\u2019 public-address announcer.\"<ref name=Kauffman/> Duncan also worked as a grocery bagger and salesman at [[Sears]] while working his way through school. Duncan supported [[Barry Goldwater]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]] presidential campaign, and sent the first paycheck he earned as a bagboy at the local [[A&P]] to the Goldwater campaign.<ref name=Kauffman/>\n\nDuncan graduated from the [[University of Tennessee at Knoxville]] in 1969 with a [[Bachelor of Journalism]] degree and subsequently received a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[George Washington University Law School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1973 and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] that same year.

I have a very conservative Republican district. My Uncle Joe is one of the most respected judges in Tennessee: when I get in a really serious bind I go to him for advice.
