Formed in 1969, the CBC was founded to strengthen African-American lawmakers' ability to address the legislative concerns of Black and minority citizens. He has served longer in Congress than any other African American. In 1971, he was one of the original members of [[Nixon's Enemies List]].\n\nIn 1965, John Conyers won a seat as a freshman on the influential [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], which was then under the leadership of Democratic Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]] of New York. At the time, the assignment was an elite one, as Judiciary ranked behind only [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means]] and [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] in terms of the number of Members who sought assignment there.<ref>http://baic.house.gov/education/lesson-plans/essay3.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[National Journal]]'', Conyers has been considered, with [[Pete Stark]], [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]], [[Jim McDermott]], and [[Barbara Lee]], to be one of the most [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] members of Congress for many years. [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955\u20131968)|Civil rights]] icon [[Rosa Parks]] served on Conyers' staff between 1965 and 1988.\n\nConyers is known as one of the opponents of the drive to regulate [[online gambling]]. He has likened the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]], hidden within the [[SAFE Port Act]], to Prohibition.\n\nAfter Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination in 1968, Conyers introduced the first bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. It is now celebrated as [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]].\n\nConyers introduced the \"Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act\" (H.R. 40) in January 1989, and has re-introduced anew this bill each congressional term. This bill calls for the creation of a commission to research the history of [[slavery]] and its effects on current America, resulting in recommendations on how to remedy this injustice. Its current version was introduced and referred to committee on January 3, 2013.<ref>http://conyers.house.gov/index.cfm/reparations and https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr40</ref>\n\nConyers first introduced the House of Resolution 40 in 1989, and have annual proposed this act until it is approved and passed. The House Resolution 40 expresses the impact of slavery's brutal institution on today's society, politics, and economy. \"My bill does four things:\nIt acknowledges the fundamental injustice and inhumanity of slavery\nIt establishes a commission to study slavery, its subsequent racial and economic discrimination against freed slaves;\nIt studies the impact of those forces on today's living African Americans; and\nThe commission would then make recommendations to Congress on appropriate remedies to redress the harm inflicted on living African Americans.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Conyers|first1=John|title=Reparations|url=http://conyers.house.gov/index.cfm/reparations|website=http://conyers.house.gov|publisher=John Conyers|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Nixon and Watergate\nConyers was critical of [[Richard Nixon]] during his tenure, and as a result was number 13 on [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon's Enemies List|enemies list]] during Nixon's 1969\u201374 presidential tenure. The president's Chief Counsel described him as \"coming on fast,\" and that he was \"emerging\" as a \"black anti-Nixon spokesman.\"<ref>http://www.enemieslist.info/enemy.php?ID=13</ref><ref>Also see Wikisource transcription of Nixon's enemies list</ref>\n\nConyers voted on the [[Articles of Impeachment]] against Nixon in July 1974. He is the last remaining member of the House Judiciary Committee who did so, although another fellow Committee member, Democratic Congressman [[Charles B. Rangel]], of New York, is still in Congress.\n\n;National Health Care Act\nThe [[United States National Health Care Act]] (Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act) (H.R. 676) is a bill submitted to the United States House of Representatives by Conyers which, as of September 29, 2008, has 93 cosponsors. It was first introduced, with 25 cosponsors, in 2003,<ref>{{USBill|108|HR|676}}</ref> and reintroduced each session since then. The act calls for the creation of a universal [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States, in which the government would provide every resident health care free of charge.  In order to eliminate disparate treatment between richer and poorer Americans, the Act would also prohibit private insurers from covering any treatment or procedure already covered by the Act. The bill is currently in the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce]]'s Subcommittee on Health.\n\n;Downing Street memo\nOn May 5, 2005, Conyers and 88 other members of Congress wrote an open letter to the White House inquiring about the [[Downing Street memo]], a leaked memorandum that revealed an apparent secret agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|attack Iraq]] in 2002. ''[[The Times]]'' reported that newly discovered documents reveal British and U.S. intentions to invade Iraq and leaders of the two countries had \"discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so.\" The documents go on to say that [[Tony Blair]] decided the United States would need to \"create\" conditions to justify the war.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe memo story broke in the United Kingdom, but did not receive much coverage in the United States, prompting Conyers to lament: \"This should not be allowed to fall down the memory hole during wall-to-wall coverage of the [[People v.

The evidence offered consists of statistical abnormalities in the differences between [[exit poll]] results and actual votes registered at those locations. The book also discusses reports of faulty [[electronic voting]] machines and the lack of credibility of those machines used to tally votes.\n\nHe was one of 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web |date=January 6, 2005 |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml |title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7 |publisher=clerk.house.gov |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n;The Constitution in Crisis\n{{see also|Lead-up to the Iraq War|Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq}}\nOn August 4, 2006, Conyers released his report, ''The Constitution in Crisis: The Downing Street Minutes and Deception, Manipulation, Torture, Retributions and Cover-ups in the Iraq War,'' an edited collection of information intended to serve as evidence that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] altered [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] to justify the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n\n''The Constitution in Crisis'' examines much of the evidence presented by the Bush Administration prior to the invasion and questions the credibility of their sources of intelligence. In addition, the document investigates the conditions that led to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture scandal]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq, as well as further evidence of [[torture]] having been committed but not made known to the public. Finally, the document reports on a series of \"smear tactics\" purportedly used by the administration in dealing with its political adversaries.\n\nThe document calls for the [[censure]] of President [[George W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. Notably, however, Conyers refused to back [[Efforts to impeach George W. Bush|impeachment]] proceedings.\n\n;On anti-Muslim intolerance\nConyers has proposed [http://www.conyersblog.us/archives/00000103.htm House Resolution 288], which condemns \u201creligious intolerance\u201d but emphasizes [[Islam]] as needing special protection from acts of violence and intolerance. It states that \u201cit should never be official policy of the United States Government to disparage the [[Quran]], Islam, or any religion in any way, shape, or form,\u201d and \u201ccalls upon local, State, and Federal authorities to work to prevent [[hate crime|bias-motivated crime]]s and acts against all individuals, including those of the Islamic faith.\u201d The bill was referred [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.res.00288: to the House subcommittee on the Constitution] in June 2005.\n\n;Conyers v.
