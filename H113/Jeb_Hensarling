A member of the  [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Hensarling currently chairs the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]], and has previously served as the chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]] from 2011 to 2013.\n\n==Early life==\nHensarling was born in [[Stephenville, Texas|Stephenville]], the [[County seat|seat of government]] of [[Erath County, Texas|Erath County]] in [[Central Texas]]; he was reared on the family [[farm]] in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]]. His father, Charles Andrew \"Chase\" Hensarling (1928-2014), was also a native of Stephenville, a 1949 graduate of [[Texas A&M University]], and a [[United States Army]] officer. Charles Hensarling was engaged in the poultry business and was the president of Hy-Lay Hatcheries in [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], Texas.

He served as president of the Texas A&M Consolidated Independent School District and was a past president of Our Savior\u2019s [[Lutheran Church]] Council in College Station. He later was a member of the Abiding Savior Lutheran Church Council in [[Cameron, Texas|Cameron]] in [[Milam County, Texas|Milam County]], Texas, where he and his wife, retired.

In 1982, he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] at [[Austin, Texas|Auxtin]]. He is an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].\n\n==Political career==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jeb hensaling photo.jpg|thumb|left|Jeb Hensarling (center) being sworn in by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Dennis Hastert]] (left).]] -->\nPrior to serving in Congress, Hensarling was State Director for Texas [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Phil Gramm]] from 1985 until 1989. From 1991 to 1993, he served as executive director of the Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nHensarling next served as a vice president at two companies before becoming owner of San Jacinto Ventures in 1996 and [[CEO]] of Family Support Assurance Corporation in 2001. He served as vice president of [[Green Mountain Energy]] from 1999 to 2001.\n\nHensarling was elected to his first term in 2002, defeating [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] opponent Ron Chapman with 58 percent of the vote. He was reelected in 2004 with 64 percent of the vote over Democratic challenger Bill Bernstein.\n\nA December 31, 2005 article in ''[[National Review]]'' profiled his work as the country's \"budget nanny\", saying that he has replaced his mentor, former Senator [[Phil Gramm]], in this role. Hensarling's proposed legislation is said to intend to force Congress to \"decide how much money they can afford to spend, and then prioritize within those limits.\" The article says that \"the chief problem with any proposal to reform the budget process is that it excites almost nobody.\"\n\nHensarling was elected chairman of the [[Republican Study Committee]] following the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 Congressional elections]], defeating [[Todd Tiahrt]].\n\nAfter the 2012 election, Hensarling was elected as chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services, succeeding Rep. [[Spencer Bachus]] (R-Ala.).<ref>{{cite news|title=Hensarling Elected House Financial Services Committee Chairman|url=http://hensarling.house.gov/news/press-releases/2012/11/hensarling-elected-house-financial-services-committee-chairman.shtml|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=The Office of Rep.

In 2007, he introduced the [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights]]. He also co-authored the [[Taxpayer Choice Act]].\n\n=== 2008 ===\nIn January 2008, Hensarling co-authored the Economic Growth Act of 2008.\n\nIn May 2008, Hensarling pressed the Republican party leadership in the House to agree to a special session to give lawmakers to air their views on a new policy platform and share ideas on how to define themselves to better advantage going into the 2008 election.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n=== 2010 ===\nOn January 29, 2010, during President [[Barack Obama]]'s meeting with House Republicans, Hensarling challenged Obama's position on the budget, asserting that the Obama White House was increasing the national deficit at the same rate per month that the previous President had increased it per year.  President Obama responded with the following: \"the whole question was structured as a talking point for running a campaign....[t]he fact of the matter is that when we came into office, the deficit was $1.3 trillion.

After voting against the bill, Hensarling said,\n\n{{cquote|no one truly knows if this plan will work \u2013 though we all hope that it does. No one knows the true amount of taxpayer exposure. Treasury could spend $700 billion in no time flat and come right back to Congress for $700 billion more. Some believe the taxpayer will actually make money in the deal and I hope that proves true. But history as a guide, I have strong fears it will not. At what point do we finally bailout the American taxpayer from the unconscionable burden he or she faces from out of control Washington spending? I fear that the legislation passed by Congress remains more of a bailout than a work out. I fear it undermines the ethic of personal responsibility. I fear that it rewards bad behavior and punishes good. But my greatest fear is that it changes the role of the federal government in our free market economy, which despite its current problems, remains the envy of the world. How can we have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down? If we lose our ability to fail will we not in turn lose our ability to succeed? If Congress bails out some firms and sectors, how can it say no to others? We must always be very careful to ensure that any remedy does allow short-term gain to come at the cost of even greater long-term pain \u2013 that being the slippery slope to socialism. The thought of my children growing up in America with less freedom and less opportunity is a long-term pain I cannot bear.}}\n\nFollowing September 29 House vote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 777 points in a single day, its largest single-day point drop ever.  The House subsequently passed the bill in a second vote on October 3.\n\nOn November 19, 2008 Hensarling was appointed by United States House of Representatives Minority Leader [[John Boehner]] to serve on the five-member [[Congressional Oversight Panel]] created to oversee the implementation of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act]]. He was the lone dissenting member on the \"Accountability for the Troubled Asset Relief Program\" report issued by the panel on January 9, 2009.<ref>[http://cop.senate.gov/documents/cop-010909-report.pdf Accountability for the Troubled Asset Relief Program]</ref>\n\n== House leadership ==\nIn 2008, Hensarling was mentioned as a possible candidate for [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Conference]] Chairman, then the number three position in the House Republican leadership.
