The district is located in the north-central portion of the state and includes [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], [[Tiffin, Ohio|Tiffin]], and [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]].\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nJordan was born and raised in [[Champaign County, Ohio]] and attended [[Graham High School (St. Paris, Ohio)|Graham High School]], graduating in 1982. While at Graham, he was a four-time state wrestling champion with a career record of 150-1.

Before entering politics, he was an assistant wrestling coach with the Ohio State University wrestling program.\n\n==Ohio Legislature==\nJordan was first elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio General Assembly]] in November 1994 and went on to serve three terms as State Representative of the 85th Ohio House District. In 1996, he offered an amendment to the Welfare Reform Bill that limited the amount of time that an able-bodied individual could remain on welfare. He also created the Income Tax Reduction Fund, which required that any state revenue surpluses be used to lower the income tax burden on Ohioans rather than be used for further government spending.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 2000, he won a seat in the [[Ohio Senate]] by defeating independent candidate Jack Kaffenberger by a margin of 88 percent to 12 percent. In 2004, Jordan defeated Kaffenberger again, this time by a smaller margin of 79 percent to 21 percent. In May 2006, Jordan won the Republican primary race for the 4th Congressional district of Ohio. He also won a 100% lifetime rating from the Ohio Taxpayers Association, which endorsed Jordan in his bid for Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiotaxpayers.com |title=ohiotaxpayers.com |publisher=ohiotaxpayers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>\n\nJordan was named Watchdog of the Treasury (1996, 2000, 2004), Outstanding Legislator (2004), Outstanding Freshman Legislator (1996), Friend of the Taxpayer (1997), and Pro-Life Legislator of the Year (1998) by the United Conservatives of Ohio, the Defender of Life award from the Ohio Right to Life Society, and the 2001 Leadership in Government Award from the Ohio Roundtable and Freedom Forum.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Additionally, Senate President [[Bill Harris (Ohio politician)|Bill Harris]] appointed Jordan to be the chairman of the Senate Judiciary on Criminal Justice Committee.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\nJordan won the Republican primary for the 4th District in 2006 after 26-year incumbent [[Mike Oxley]] announced his retirement.  Despite the strong anti-Republican mood in Ohio that year, Jordan skated to victory in the general election, defeating Democrat [[Rick Siferd]] in the general election, 60% to 40%.  The 4th has long been reckoned as one of the most (if not ''the'' most) Republican districts in Ohio and the nation; the district and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but 16 years since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nHe was reelected in 2008, defeating Democrat Mike Carroll 65% to 35%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/electResultsMain/2008ElectionResults/congress110408.aspx |title=U.S. Congress: November 4, 2008 |publisher=Sos.state.oh.us |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>\n\nJordan chaired the [[Republican Study Committee]] during the 112th Congress.
