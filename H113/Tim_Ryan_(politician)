The district, numbered as the {{ushr|OH|17|17th district}} from 2003 to 2013, takes in a large swath of northeast Ohio, from [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] to [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He previously served in the [[Ohio Senate]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nTim Ryan was born in [[Niles, Ohio]] and graduated from [[John F. Kennedy High School (Warren, Ohio)|John F. Kennedy High School]] in [[Warren, Ohio|Warren]], where he played football as a [[quarterback]]<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.ohio.com/mld/beaconjournal/news/state/16232383.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and coached junior high basketball. Ryan is of Irish and Italian ancestry. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]] from [[Bowling Green State University]] in 1995 and was a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity. In 2000, he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timryan.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27&Itemid=49 |title=Biography |publisher=Timryan.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>  Ryan served on the staff of controversial U.S. Representative [[James Traficant|Jim Traficant]] (D-Ohio) in the mid-1990s. From 2000 to 2002 he served half a term in the [[Ohio State Senate]].\n\n===Congressional campaigns===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 13}}\nAfter Jim Traficant was convicted on criminal charges in 2002, Ryan declared his candidacy for the 17th District. As the result of [[redistricting]] following the 2000 [[census]], the 17th, which had long been based in Youngstown, had been pushed to the west and now included much of [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage County]] and part of Akron. Before the redistricting, all of Akron had been part of the 14th District, represented by eight-term Democrat [[Thomas C. Sawyer|Tom Sawyer]]. The 14th had been eliminated in the year 2000 redistricting; most of it was drawn into the 13th District of fellow Democrat [[Sherrod Brown]], but Sawyer's home was drawn into the 17th. In the 2002 Democratic primary, Ryan defeated Sawyer, who was seen as insufficiently labor-friendly in the newly-drawn district. In the November 2002 general election, he faced Republican Insurance Commissioner [[Ann Womer Benjamin]] as well as Traficant, who ran as an independent from his prison cell.  He won with 51 percent of the vote, besting Benjamin by a solid 14-point margin. When he took office in January 2003, he was the youngest Democrat in the House, at 29 years of age.  He has been reelected five times, <ref>http://www.fec.gov/press/press2005/20050113mur.html</ref><ref>Cleveland.com [http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2008/04/congressman_tim_ryan_endorses_1.html Congressman Tim Ryan endorses Clinton] April 19, 2008</ref> only once facing another contest nearly as close as his first one.  In 2010, he was held to 53 percent of the vote; Traficant, running as an independent, took 16 percent of the vote.  It is the only time since Ryan's first run for the seat that he has not tallied at least 70 percent of the vote.\n\n==United States Representative==\n\n===House legislative career===\nRyan is a member of the [[30 Something Working Group|\"30 Something\" Working Group]],<ref>[http://www.speaker.house.gov/communities?id=0001 Speaker Nancy Pelosi | Communities | 30 Something Working Group<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  which is a [[Congressional caucus]] that includes those members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who are Democrats and have not yet reached the age of 40.
