He won again in 2000 with 59 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2002 with 68 percent of the vote. In 2004, he defeated Democrat Lewis Myers with 71.5% of the vote per [http://www.ocvote.com/live/e13/frameset.htm OCvote.com], the official county elections office website. Similarly, he won in 2008 with 63.8% of the vote, defeating Democrat Ed Chau.\n\nFor his first seven terms in Congress, Miller represented a district comprising portions of northern and eastern [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], southern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] and a small portion of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]]. After the [[2010 United States Census]], Miller's district was renumbered as the 39th District, and pushed further into Orange County, making this already strongly Republican seat even more so. The new map also placed the home of fellow Republican and 10-term incumbent [[Ed Royce]] into the 39th, setting up what would have been the only primary contest between two California Republicans. Although the 39th was more Miller's district than Royce's (Miller retained 53 percent of his former territory), Royce was considered the stronger candidate. Partly due to this, Miller announced in January 2012 that he would run in the newly created 31st District, located entirely in San Bernardino County. Miller's move effectively ended the career of [[House Rules Committee]] chairman [[David Dreier]], who had represented a large slice of the new 31st.<ref>Trygstad, Kyle.

''[[Roll Call]]'', 2012-01-12.</ref> As part of the move, he bought a second home in [[Rancho Cucamonga]], which he now claims as his official residence.\n\nOn paper, Miller faced daunting odds. He was running in a district that he had never represented before, had a sizable Democratic lean and was majority-Hispanic. Had it existed in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] would have won it with 56 percent of the vote. However, due to California's new \"top-two\" primary system, the three Democrats in the field split the vote, allowing Miller to come in first with only 27 percent of the vote while a fellow Republican, State Senator [[Bob Dutton]] came in second with 25 percent while three Democrats split the remaining 48 percent of the vote. In the general election, Miller defeated Dutton with 55 percent of the vote.\n\n===Tenure===\n\n'''Transportation and infrastructure'''\n\nCongressman Miller is the most senior Republican from the California delegation on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/seniority-112.pdf |title=Seniority list of the United States House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress |publisher=Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> He serves on the Highways and Transit; Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials; and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittees.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure - The United States House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress|url=http://transportation.house.gov/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Congressman Miller secured a provision in the 2005 SAFE-TEA LU Highway Reauthorization that initiated a pilot program where 5 states, including California would assume the responsibility for conducting the federal environmental review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In California, the NEPA pilot program has shaved 17 months off of environmental review processes and 30 months off of overall project delivery.\n\n;Streamlining regulations and review for transportation projects\nDuring the 112th Congress, Miller introduced legislation to build off the success of the 2005 pilot program to further improve highway project delivery by eliminating bureaucratic red tape and restoring greater control to state and local governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.2538: |title=112th Congress (2011-2012) - H.R.2538 -- REBUILD Act (Introduced in House - IH) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=July 14, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, he introduced the Environmental Review Cooperation Act, which would make permanent a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) pilot program that authorizes five states\u2014including California\u2014to take on the responsibility of complying with NEPA for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funded projects.

Normally, he would have had to pay state and federal taxes of up to 31% on that profit.\n\nMiller told the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the state of California that Monrovia had forced him to sell the property under threat of [[eminent domain]]. That allowed him to shelter the profits from capital gains taxes for more than two years before he had to reinvest the money.\n\nMonrovia officials stated that Miller sold the land willingly and that they didn't threaten to force him to sell. A videotape of a February 2000 City Council meeting shows Miller asking city officials four times to buy his land. Another, earlier videotape confirmed Miller's position that the city had refused to let him develop the land and threatened \"condemnation\" of his property for public use. Although all early drafts of Monrovia's sales contract with Miller included the phrase \"friendly condemnation\", it was deleted when the final deal was made. Miller and his wife signed an amendment to the escrow instructions on August 1, 2002, saying, \"condemnation deleted\", or no longer in effect.<ref name=\"otb\">{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-miller13aug13,0,2223572.story?coll=la-home-headlines | title=Official's Tax Break: on Firm Ground? | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2006-08-13 | first=William | last=Heisel | accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref>\n\nMiller took an exemption again in 2005 when he sold the 10 lots to the city of [[Fontana, California|Fontana]] and again in 2006 when he sold a building to Fontana, claiming both were compulsory sales.

As of 2008, no investigation or legal action could be confirmed.\n\n;2005 profits from dealings with business partner and federal transportation bill\nAs a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Miller pushed for a provision in the 2005 transportation bill that allowed the city of [[Rialto, California|Rialto]] to close its airport, the first time an act of Congress has ever shuttered an airport. It is a power the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] traditionally has had sole authority to exercise. The closing of the airport paved the way for Lewis Operating, a business partner and campaign contributor, to win a multimillion dollar contract from the city to develop the airport land and build a planned community consisting of 2,500 homes, parks and {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of retail space on the former airport and adjacent land.\n\nMiller also helped secure $1.28 million in that bill for street improvements in front of a planned housing and retail center, including a [[Target Corporation|Target]] store that he co-owned with Lewis Operating.\n\nMiller took out nearly $7.5 million in promissory notes in 2004 from Lewis Operating, which he used to purchase land from the company. In 2005, he sold some of that land to a part of the company, making a profit of between $1.1 million and $6 million, according to his financial disclosure report (which requires reporting a dollar range, not an exact dollar figure). The majority of the parcels that Miller bought are about two miles (3&nbsp;km) from the airport.\n\nHouse Rules explicitly state that before entering into loans from an entity other than a financial institution, members of Congress and staff must submit the terms of the loans for review and a determination from the ethics committee on whether the loan is acceptable under the gift rule. It is not clear if Miller complied with this requirement.<ref name=\"ethics\">{{cite news | url = http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/080906/miller.html | title = Miller may have violated House ethics rules by borrowing $7.5M | newspaper = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date = 2006-08-09 | first = Susan | last = Crabtree | accessdate = 2007-02-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061219042535/http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/080906/miller.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-19}}</ref>\n\n;December 2006 allegations\nIn December 2006, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Miller had used \"congressional muscle\" for \"personal business matters\".<ref name=\"pabuse\">{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-miller12dec12,0,5767098.story?coll=la-home-headlines | title=Ex-aides allege abuse of power|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 12, 2006 | first=William | last=Heisel | accessdate = 2006-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> This included having congressional staff do Miller's personal errands, collecting nearly $25,000 a year in rent from his campaign committee, using the offices of his real estate development firm as his campaign office, and ordering an aide to find a way to get a city business-friendly council member on the [[United States Department of the Interior|National Park Board]] who was involved in a city purchase of Miller's property.<ref name=\"pabuse\" />\n\n;May 2010 allegations\nIn May 2010, the ''FOX'' affiliate MyFOXLA interviewed Miller over claims led by [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) stating he \"directed millions of dollars in government money to non-profits headed by one of his campaign contributor[s], developer Jeffrey Burum\".<ref name=\"pabuse9\">{{cite news | url=http://www.myfoxla.com/dpp/news/local/congressman-under-fire-over-earmarks-20100506 | title=Congressman Under Fire Over Earmarks|publisher=[[MyFOXLA]] | date=May 6, 2010 | first=Gina | last=Silva | accessdate = 2010-05-07}}</ref>{{dead link|date=September 2014}} Burum, his company, and his wife donated $26,350<ref name=\"pabuse10\">{{cite news | url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/can_ind/H8CA41063/A-E/ | title=Individuals Who Gave To: MILLER, GARY G.
