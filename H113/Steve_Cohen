He held that position for 24 years.<ref name=\"PVS\" />\n\nFor 18 years, Cohen strove to repeal the ban on lotteries in the [[Tennessee State Constitution]].<ref name=\"Flyer\" /> His efforts were successful in 2002, and a [[Tennessee Lottery|state lottery program]] designed to provide college scholarships for Tennessee students was adopted the following year.<ref name=\"Flyer\" /> The lottery program is regarded as the most well-known accomplishment of Cohen's Senate career, having raised over $2 billion for scholarships, afterschool programs, pre-K, technical center grants, and energy saving capital programs in K-12 schools as of 2012.<ref name=\"Flyer\" /> Cohen also sponsored legislation relating to expansion of community access to healthcare, the protection of animal rights, the reinstatement of voting rights, graduated driver licenses, and funding for the arts during his career.<ref name=\"Flyer\" /> He sponsored the T-Bo law, the nation's first-ever statute providing for damages up to $5000 in cases of intentional or negligent acts resulting in the death of a companion dog or cat.<ref>[http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=860 , Animal Defense Fund]</ref> He has won four awards from the Humane Society as of 2012.\n\nHe sponsored and passed legislation providing funding for the construction of the Autozone Park baseball stadium, creating the Holocaust Commission, and providing permanent funding for the arts with Tennesseans for the Arts license plates.

One Tennessee writer described him as \"very outspoken, very persistent, and a lot more cerebral than most of his colleagues.\"<ref name=\"TNR\" />\n\nWhen elected in 1982, Cohen was the first [[Jewish]] member to serve in the [[Tennessee Senate]] since 1958.<ref name=\"TNR\" />\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n\n;1996\nIn 1996, Cohen ran for election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] seat for the 9th District, which came open when 22-year incumbent and fellow Democrat [[Harold Ford, Sr.]] announced his retirement. The then 26-year-old [[Harold Ford, Jr.]], the incumbent's son, was his opponent in the Democratic primary.<ref name=\"TNR\" /> Reflecting on the race, Cohen said, \"I'd spent fourteen years in the [state] Senate, had the experience, and didn't like the idea of [the seat] being handed down like an heirloom.\"<ref name=\"TNR\" />\n\nCohen lost the primary to Ford by 25 points.<ref name=\"Flyer\" /> Noting that Ford, an African-American, did much better than Cohen in majority black precincts despite Ford's inexperience, Cohen said, \"It is impossible for a person who is not African American to get a large vote in the African American community... against a substantial candidate. The fact is, I am white, and it doesn't seem to matter what you do.\"<ref name=\"TNR\" /> Later, Cohen admitted that his statement was \"impolitic\" but also noted that \"race is still an important factor in voting.\"<ref name=\"TNR\" />\n\nCohen was able to return to the State Senate after the election.  Tennessee state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Cohen did not have to run for reelection to the Senate until 1998.\n\n;2006\nIn early April 2006, Cohen announced that he was again running for the 9th District seat; Ford, Jr. was not running for reelection.

The Ford family has been a significant force in Memphis' black community since the days of [[E.H. Crump]]. Indeed, it seemed that the real race was between Cohen and Jake Ford.  White was not a serious factor, and would have faced nearly impossible odds even in a two-way race with Cohen.\n\nCohen was endorsed by the mayor of Memphis, [[W. W.

The Ford family itself was split. While Harold Ford, Jr. himself remained neutral (despite rumors of collusion between the two brothers' campaigns), their cousin Joe Ford, Jr., an entertainment lawyer, strongly endorsed Cohen after finishing third in the primary.

Besides some sentiment that the 9th should be represented by a black Democrat, his socially liberal views (see below) also gave them pause.  For example, Cohen's support for a hate-crimes bill drew particularly strong opposition from most of the city's black ministers because it included a sexual orientation provision.  Cohen contends that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for the bill, and Harold Ford, Jr. had voted for it in the previous Congress.  Still, many of the city's black ministers tried to rally behind a consensus black candidate to challenge Cohen in the Democratic primary.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14810455 In Memphis, Debate Over a White Representative].
