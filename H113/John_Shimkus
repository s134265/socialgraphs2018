He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district was numbered as the 20th from 1997 to 2003 and the 19th from 2003 to 2013.\n\nThe district includes much of the southern portion of the state, taking in part of [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and a portion of the [[Metro-East]], which is the Illinois side of the [[St. Louis]] area.\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nShimkus is a lifelong resident of [[Collinsville, Illinois|Collinsville]], a suburb of St. Louis.  He is the son of Kathleen N. (n\u00e9e Mondy) and Gene L. Shimkus. His paternal grandfather was of [[Lithuania]]n descent.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/shimkus.htm</ref> While in the Army, he earned the [[Expert Infantry Badge]], [[Ranger tab]], and [[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist Badge]] as well as served overseas with the [[54th Infantry Regiment (United States)|54th Infantry Regiment]] in [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"AUSA2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ausa.org/legislation/congressionalinfo/Documents/OAS%20112th%20Congress.pdf |title=Once a Soldier... Always a Soldier |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2011 |work=Legislative Agenda |publisher=[[Association of the United States Army]] |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe first ran for office in 1989, when he was elected a [[Collinsville Township, Madison County, Illinois|Collinsville Township]] trustee. A year later, he was elected as [[Madison County, Illinois|Madison County]] treasurer.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2013}}\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]'''\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|Subcommittee on Communications and Technology]]\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy|Subcommittee on Environment and Economy]], chairman\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]]\n* '''[[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]]'''\n\n==Political positions==\n\n===Food safety===\nShimkus has recently{{When|date=August 2011}} been a proponent of legislation to increase the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the bill, he said: \"When you're talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority.\"<ref name=\"food safety\"/>\n\n===Climate Change===\nShimkus rejects the human-induced theory of climate change and opposes [[emissions trading]] legislation. On March 25, 2009, in introductory remarks made to [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley]], during a [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment]] hearing, he made the following statement regarding the role of [[carbon dioxide]] in [[global warming]]: <blockquote>\"It's plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.\"<ref name=\"capping co2\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe then quoted the Bible in attempting to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood.<ref>http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44958.html</ref> He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on something that cannot be changed versus the changes that have been occurring forever.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1328366/John-Shimkus-Global-warming-wont-destroy-planet-God-promised-Noah.html | work=Daily Mail | title='The planet won't be destroyed by global warming because God promised Noah,' says politician bidding to chair U.S. energy committee | location=London | date=November 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2006 Mark Foley scandal===\n[[File:John Shimkus, official photo portrait color.jpg|thumb|right|Earlier official photo of Shimkus]]\n{{main|Mark Foley scandal}}\n\nShimkus said \"that in late-2005 he learned--through information passed along by Alexander's office--about an e-mail exchange in which Foley asked about the youngster's well-being after [[Hurricane Katrina]] and requested a photograph.\"<ref name=\"pageconcerned\">{{cite news | url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/09/sixteenyearold_.html | title=Sixteen-Year-Old Who Worked as Capitol Hill Page Concerned About E-mail Exchange with Congressman | publisher=The Blotter, [[ABC News]] | date=September 28, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-05}}</ref>\n\n===Keystone pipeline===\n{{main|Keystone pipeline}}\n\nIn May 2013, Shimkus stated he wants to renew his support for the [[Keystone pipeline]]. The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian [[crude oil]] through the Midwest\u2014through Illinois. As a supporter, he stated that he would rather see Canada as an energy partner than ship in oil from overseas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2013/05/31/illinois-reps-shimkus-and-davis-renew-push-for-keystone-pipeline/ |title=Illinois Reps.

He was defeated by 10-year [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[Dick Durbin]].\n\nFour years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the [[United States Senate]]. Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced [[Illinois House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Jay C. Hoffman]] in a close general election for U.S. Representative in the then 20th Congressional District of Illinois, which Shimkus won.  \n\nHe has only faced one credible opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th District of two-term Democratic representative [[David D. Phelps]]. The new district retained Phelps' district number, but geographically and demographically was more Shimkus' district, as he retained 60 percent of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other's staffers of stalking their families.<ref name=\"stay close\"/> Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, he was reelected.\n\nHe announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge<ref name=\"pledge\"/> when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.\n\nFEC records show that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] in 2005. The fund also made contributions to [[Peter Roskam]], a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 6th district, from 2005 to 2008 and to [[David McSweeney]], a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 8th district, in 2006.<ref name=\"query\"/><ref name=\"query1\"/><ref name=\"query2\"/> Recently the funds treasurer, lobbyist Mark Valente, resigned. Shimkus earlier said he was considering removing Valente, but he didn't want to act too quickly because it might suggest there was something improper about their relationship.<ref name=\"lobbyist\"/>\n\n==Electoral history==\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2010#District 19}}\nThe {{ushr|Illinois|20|20th district}} was disbanded after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], which is why Shimkus faced [[David D.
