Hanna''' (born January 25, 1951)<ref>Christina Paris [http://news.yahoo.com/s/cq/20101103/pl_cq_politics/politics000003758247_1 112th Congress: Richard Hanna, R-N.Y. (24th District)] ''[[CQ Politics]]'' November 3, 2010</ref> is an [[United States|American]] politician who has served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[New York]] since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. His district was numbered the [[New York's 24th congressional district|24th]] during his first two years in Congress; since 2013, it has been the {{ushr|NY|22|22nd district}}. \n\n== Early life, education, and business career ==\nHanna was born in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and raised in [[Marcy, New York|Marcy]]. His grandparents owned a [[dairy farm]] in [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]]. He graduated from Whitesboro High School in Marcy. Then, he graduated from [[Reed College]] with a bachelor's degree in [[Economics]] and [[Political Science]]. After college, Hanna returned to New York to start his own construction business called Hanna Construction.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/AP130006b0837c4a4a8165804738532220.html Clinton stumps for NY House Dems in tight races] ''[[Associated Press]]'' November 1, 2010</ref> Hanna is of [[Lebanese American|Lebanese descent]].<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E1678-4 \"Honoring Lebanon on it's 70th Independence Day\" Hon.

In 2010, he ran in a rematch and won.\n\nDue to redistricting, Hanna ran in the new [[New York's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]] in 2012.\n\nIn his 2012 campaign for re-election against Democrat [[Dan Lamb]], television stations [[WUTR]] in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[WSYR-TV|WSYR]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] announced they would jointly air a debate between Hanna and Lamb. Hanna declined to participate, citing another scheduled televised debate and five that would not be televised. The stations said that if Hanna did not appear, they would air a 30-minute question-and-answer session with Lamb. According to Steve Merren, the vice president and general manager of WUTR's parent company, [[Nexstar Broadcasting Group]], Hanna then contacted Merren. In an email to staff, Merren stated, \"He indicated to me that we would not be considered for his ad dollars and our level of cooperation in the future could be affected.\" Merren then directed that WUTR not go ahead with the broadcast. Both Merren and a Hanna spokeswoman denied that threats had been made. After the inadvertent disclosure of the internal email, Merren told the press that Hanna \u201cdid not say he would pull his ad dollars.\" The Hanna campaign said that his conversation with Merren had been \"nothing more than a courtesy call\". The Lamb campaign said that Hanna was \"using his money to influence the journalistic decisions of a local news agency.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = GOP Congressman Threatens Local News Station for Covering Debate| publisher = [[Common Dreams]]| date = October 6, 2012 | url = http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/318-66/13825-gop-congressman-threatens-local-news-station-for-covering-debate| accessdate = October 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Email: Hanna discussed pulling ads after debate flap with WUTR| publisher = [[Observer Dispatch]]| date = October 6, 2012 | url = http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1931761214/Email-Hanna-discussed-pulling-ads-after-debate-flap-with-WUTR | accessdate = October 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Tenure ===\nHanna is a member of the conservative [[Republican Study Committee]] and the centrist [[Republican Main Street Partnership]].

Hanna was also a co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity by covered entities (employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, or joint labor-management committees, but exempts religious organizations) nationwide.  New York already has already passed similar legislation into law within the State of New York, but the practice remains legal in 29 U.S. states.  But Rep Hanna is one of several Republican co-sponsors of the bill who refused to sign a Discharge Petition on the bill \u2014 a parliamentary maneuver that allows a majority of members of Congress to bring any bill to the floor, even if the leadership opposes doing so.\n\nIn June 2013, Hanna voted against proposed legislation to ban [[abortions]] after 20 weeks of pregnancy except for victims of [[rape]] or [[incest]] who have reported the crime to authorities. He opposes partial birth abortions, but stated that he was unable to support this legislation because it would cast aside exception for the health of the mother, and it fails to adequately account for unique circumstances that can arise after 20 weeks because every pregnancy is specific.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2013/06/18/hanna-sole-new-york-republican-to-oppose-house-abortion-bill/ |title=Hanna sole New York Republican to oppose House abortion bill |last1=Tumulty |first1=Brian |date=June 18, 2013 |publisher=Politics on the Hudson |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]]'''\n**[[United States House Education Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education|Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education]]\n**[[United States House Education Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training|Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]]'''\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management|Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management]]\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Highways and Transit|Subcommittee on Highways and Transit]] (Vice Chair)\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials|Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials]]\n[http://transportation.house.gov/subcommittees/subcommittee/?ID=107422 United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Small Business|Committee on Small Business]]'''\n\n== Personal life ==\nHanna lives in [[Barneveld, New York]].
