Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.<ref>{{cite news|title=The House GOP's Little Rule Change That Guaranteed A Shutdown|author=Scott, D.|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/the-house-gop-s-little-rule-change-that-guaranteed-a-shutdown?c=upworthy|newspaper=TPM|date=October 10, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=House Republicans Changed The Rules So A Majority Vote Couldn't Stop The Government Shutdown|author=Alman, A.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/13/house-republicans-rules-change_n_4095129.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 13, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=As Democrats seethe over GOP tactics, video over rules change goes viral|author=Eilperin, J.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/14/as-democrats-seethe-over-gop-tactics-video-over-rules-change-goes-viral/|newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Legislation===\nCantor was a strong supporter of the [[Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act]], which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.<ref name=\"WPgabriellastory\"/> The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into [[Childhood cancer|pediatric cancer]] through the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref name=WPgabriellastory>{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Caitlin|title=Federal pediatric medical research act named for Gabriella Miller|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/federal-pediatric-medical-research-act-named-for-gabriella-miller/2013/11/14/f87b42e0-4d72-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=2019cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 2019 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr2019.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.<ref name=\"WPgabriellastory\"/><ref name=\"2019cbo\"/> As of 2014, the [[United States presidential nominating convention|national conventions]] got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.<ref name=HooperConventionWipeout>{{cite news|last=Hooper|first=Molly K.|title=Convention wipeout coming soon?|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/196920-convention-wipeout|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Cantor said that the bill \"clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions\".<ref name=\"WPgabriellastory\"/>\n\n==Political positions==\nFor much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only [[Jew]]ish Republican in the United States Congress.<ref name=\"Cantorelected\"/><ref name=Barone2008/><ref name=Roig-Franzia2008/> He supports strong [[United States]]-[[Israel]] relations.<ref name=Bacalis2002/><ref name=Barone2008/> He [[sponsor (legislative)|cosponsored]] legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the [[Palestinian Authority]] and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"jweekly cantor\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/18804/jewish-minyan-grows-in-senate-jew-elected-to-house/|title=Jewish minyan grows in Senate; Jew elected to House|last=Samber|first=Sharon|date=November 8, 2002|work=JWeekly|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref> Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75&nbsp;million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]].
