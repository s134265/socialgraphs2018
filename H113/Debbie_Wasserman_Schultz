She was appointed to the [[Democratic Steering and Policy Committee]] in her first term.  During the 2006 elections, she raised over seventeen million dollars in campaign contributions for her Democratic colleagues (third most after [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Rahm Emanuel]]), she was chosen as Chief Deputy Whip and appointed to the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], a plum assignment for a sophomore congresswoman. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nShe currently chairs the Committee's [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch|Legislative Branch subcommittee]], which Pelosi returned to the Committee after it was dissolved by Republican leadership in 2005.

She publicly accused President [[George W. Bush]] of hypocrisy for signing a 1999 bill as governor of [[Texas]] that allows [[health care]] workers to remove [[life support]] for terminally ill patients if the patient or family is unable to pay the medical bills. During the debate Wasserman Schultz pointed out that a Texas law signed into law by then Gov. George W. Bush allowed caregivers to withhold treatment \"at the point that futility has been reached and there is no longer any hope of survival or of additional health care measures being used to sustain life.&nbsp;... [this] seems to conflict with his position today.\" [[Cox News Service]] reported that \"The Texas law was intended to control in cases in which medical teams and patients' representatives disagree on treatment. In the Schiavo case, the medical team and Schiavo's husband agreed that there was no hope of improvement in her condition, determined by lower courts to be a 'persistent vegetative state'.\"<ref>{{cite news|date= March 22, 2005|title=In Texas, Bush sided with spouses in cases like this|author=Herman, Ken|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer| agency=[[Cox News Service]]|url= http://www.seattlepi.com/national/217023_texas22.html|accessdate=January 9, 2007}}</ref> Wasserman Schultz also cited the case of [[n:Texas baby removed from life support against mother's wishes|a six-month-old Texas baby whose life support had been removed]] in accord with this law and over the objections of his family while the Schiavo controversy was ongoing.\n\nAfter the controversy Wasserman Schultz issued a statement that said, \"The Congress is not an objective body. It is a partisan, political body. Our Members are not doctors or bioethicists. We are elected officials. The Congress is not the appropriate venue to decide end-of-life or any private, personal family dispute. That is why there are court reviews which allow for an objective evaluation of both sides of a dispute. The Congress was never designed for, and our Founding Fathers never intended, the body to make these kinds of decisions. What was lost in the midst of this debate was that this was not about pro-life interest groups, or about the parents or the husband. It wasn't about the President, or the Governor, or the Republican or Democratic party. It was about a personal family tragedy. I am worried about the direction our country is moving in. I am worried when members of Congress and the President try to overstep over twenty court rulings on a case that had gone on for years. I am worried when special interest groups exploit a family tragedy for political and financial gain. I am worried when the federal government attempts to step between a husband and a wife because members of Congress believe they know better.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lessons Learned From Terri Schiavo|url=http://www.house.gov/list/hearing/fl20_schultz/2005May.html| author=Schultz, Debbie Wasserman|date=May 1, 2005|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=January 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Middle East crisis===\nWhile her predecessor and mentor [[Peter Deutsch]] was \"among the most hawkish congressional Democrats on Middle East issues\", Wasserman Schultz, who took over his seat for Florida's 20th district, \"a heavily Jewish swath of Broward County\", has taken a more centrist approach.<ref name=\"Forward\"/> During 2005 she spoke in approval of President [[George W. Bush]]'s proposals to give financial aid to the [[Palestinian Authority]] in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets. She said \"We want to continue to focus on making sure that&nbsp;... the policy coming from Washington continues to encourage and support and nurture the peace process. In [Bush's] first four years, there was a lack of leadership coming from the administration. I know many people in the Jewish community were happy with the president's position on Israel, but the way I thought, there was an absence of leadership.&nbsp; ... So I'm glad to see there's a little more engagement and involvement from the administration.\"<ref name=\"Forward\"/>\n\nShe defended her party against suggestions that the Democrats are anti-Israel, saying \"I would stack up the Democratic  caucus's position on the support for Israel against the Republican caucus's any day of the week and be much more confident \u2014 and the Jewish community should be much more confident \u2014 in the Democrats' stewardship of Israel than the Republicans, especially if you compare the underlying reasons for both groups' support for Israel. The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home. It has references to [[Armageddon]] and biblical references that are more their interest. So I would encourage members  of the Jewish community to put their faith in Democrats, because our support for Israel is generally for the right reasons.\"<ref name=\"Forward\"/>\n\n===Presidential signing statements===\nWasserman Schultz supports the use of appropriations for future control of presidential signing statements as developed as part of questions during the House Judiciary Committee hearing on the constitutional limits of executive power July 26, 2008.<ref name=\"House Judiciary Committee hearing on the constitutional limits of executive power 26 July 2008\">{{cite web|title= Hearing on Limits of Executive Power: Debbie W.

Wasserman Schultz was unopposed in the Democratic primary election held to fill Deutsch's seat. Her Republican opponent was [[Margaret Hostetter]], a [[realtor]] who had never held public office. The 20th is so heavily Democratic that Hostetter faced nearly impossible odds in November. However, she gained notoriety for her attacks on Wasserman Schultz.  For example, Hostetter's campaign site criticized Wasserman Schultz for protesting an [[American flag]] photograph with a [[Christian cross]] on it that was on display in the workstation of a secretary in a government building. Hostetter wrote, \"Elect Margaret Hostetter to Congress November 2 and send the clear message that Americans respect and support... the foundational role [[Christianity]] has had in the formation of our great nation. Our rights come from [[God]], not the state.\" The voters rejected this viewpoint.\n\nAs expected, Wasserman Schultz won, taking 70.2% to Hostetter's 29.8%. However, Hostetter had only spent about $30,000 to get 30% of the vote (compared to Wasserman Schultz's $1.2 million). When Wasserman Schultz was sworn in on January 4, 2005, she chose to use the Hebrew Bible, or [[Tanakh]].
