Representative Smith\u2019s recollection was that Representative Miller \u2018\u2018came up and said something like, I haven\u2019t been involved in this campaign before, but if you don\u2019t change your vote, I\u2019ll get involved, and I\u2019ll make sure Brad isn\u2019t elected.\u2019\u2019<ref>http://ethics.house.gov/committee-report/investigation-certain-allegations-related-voting-medicare-prescription-drug</ref>\n\n==Political positions==\nMiller is a signer of [[Grover Norquist]]'s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]], which commits her to oppose tax increases.<!-- <ref>[http://www.atr.org/current-taxpayer-protection-pledge-signers-th-a2851 Current Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers] Americans for Tax Reform.</ref> --><ref>{{cite web |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf |accessdate=May 9, 2012\n |format=PDF |title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers - 112th Congressional List |publisher=[[Americans for Tax Reform]] |location=Washington, D.
