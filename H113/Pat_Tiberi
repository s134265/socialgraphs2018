Both of the bills were passed in 2006.\n\nTiberi voted against the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], saying the bill was \"loaded with [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s grab bag of big spending wishes.\" Following passage of the bill, Tiberi wrote a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture [[Tom Vilsack]] in an effort to bring stimulus money to his district.<ref>{{cite news|last=Koff|first=Stephen|title=Ohio congressman blasted stimulus, but now wants a piece of the pie|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/02/ohio_congressman_blasted_stimu.html|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McElhatton|first=Jim|title=Stimulus foes see value in seeking cash|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/09/stimulus-foes-see-value-in-seeking-cash/|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTiberi has been described as loyal to Speaker [[John Boehner]].<ref>Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan (20 December 2012), [http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/john-boehners-plan-b-toughest-hour-85391_Page2.html Boehner\u2019s toughest hour] ''[[Politico]]''</ref>\n\n=== Policy Positions===\n\n====Older Americans====\nThen-chairman of the Select Education Subcommittee, Pat Tiberi wrote the bill that reauthorized the Older Americans Act through fiscal year 2011.

Congressman Tiberi\u2019s goal is to introduce reform to give the president the authority to rid congressional bill of unrelated spending in bills.<ref>[http://tiberi.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=1916]</ref> Congressman Tiberi also wants to bring reform through a searchable database that would include an assessment of every piece of federal funding and the Education Oversight Subcommittee that he was appointed Vice-Chairman to in his first year in Congress.

He only won by nine points in a district that had long been considered to be far friendlier to the Democrats than the neighboring 15th, despite Kasich's long tenure.  However, Tiberi hasn't faced a close race since, in part because his district was redrawn after the 2000 census. In 2006, Tiberi won reelection after defeating former Democratic Congressman [[Bob Shamansky]].\n\n===2008===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2008#District 12}}\nTiberi defeated Democrat David Robinson.\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2010#District 12}}\nTiberi defeated Democratic nominee Franklin County Commissioner [[Paula Brooks (politician)|Paula Brooks]] in the general election.\n\n===2012===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 12}}\nTiberi defeated Democratic nominee James Reese and Green party nominee Robert Fitrakis in the general election.\n\n==Electoral history==\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 12*}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ {{ushr|Ohio|12|}}: Results 2000&ndash;2012<ref name=\"clerkresults\">{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |title=Election Statistics |accessdate=2008-01-10 |publisher=Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives }}</ref><ref>http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/Research/electResultsMain/2012Results.aspx</ref>\n!|Year\n!\n!|Democrat\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|Republican\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|3rd Party\n!|Party\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|3rd Party\n!|Party\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n|-\n|[[U.S. House election, 2000|2000]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |{{nowrap|Maryellen O'Shaughnessy}}\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} align=\"right\" |115,432\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |44%\n|\n|{{Party shading/Republican}} |'''Pat Tiberi'''\n|{{Party shading/Republican}} align=\"right\" |139,242\n|{{Party shading/Republican}} |53%\n|\n|{{Party shading/Libertarian}} |Nick Hogan\n|{{Party shading/Libertarian}} |[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]\n|{{Party shading/Libertarian}} align=\"right\" |4,546\n|{{Party shading/Libertarian}} align=\"right\" |2%\n|\n|{{Party shading/Independent}} |Gregory Richey\n|{{Party shading/Independent}} |[[Natural Law Party (United States)|Natural Law]]\n|{{Party shading/Independent}} align=\"right\" |2,600\n|{{Party shading/Independent}} align=\"right\" |1%\n| |'''*'''\n|-\n|[[U.S. House election, 2002|2002]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |[[Edward S.
