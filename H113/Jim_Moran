In January 1998, one month before he introduced the legislation, credit card bank [[MBNA]] advocated that it would restrict the ability of consumer debtors to declare bankruptcy. Moran received a favorable debt consolidation loan from the bank that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy arising from credit card and stock market losses. The $447,000 loan at a favorable [[interest rate]] was the largest loan to an individual MBNA issued in 1998. Its belated disclosure triggered a [[Federal Elections Commission]] investigation into whether or not it constituted an improper [[campaign contribution|contribution]].\n\nThe [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] at the time, [[Tim Kaine]], joined [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawmakers in calling for a [[House Ethics Committee]] investigation into the loan, saying that Moran had made \"an error in judgment\" by accepting it. In his own defense, Moran said that the timing of the legislation's introduction was coincidental and had nothing to do with the loan. MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said that the bank had offered the mortgage package not knowing that Moran was a member of Congress, and that the loan \"made good business sense\" because with the mortgage loan, \"we improved our position by getting security for an unsecured loan.... He had credit cards with us, he was having financial difficulties; this put him in a better position to be able to pay us back from a cash-flow standpoint.\"<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/09/us/bankruptcy-bill-opponents-criticize-loan.html|title=Bankruptcy Bill Opponents Criticize Loan|last=Shenon|first=Philip|date=August 9, 2002|work=New York Times|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"sundaystar\">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=20020707&id=o_EyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ywgGAAAAIBAJ&pg=6649,1357696|title=Report: Moran backed lender's cause after loan|date=July 7, 2002|publisher=Sunday Free Lance-Star|page=7|accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===PMA group===\n\nThe [[House Ethics Committee]] investigated several members of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee]], including Moran, [[Peter J.
