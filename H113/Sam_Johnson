During the Vietnam War, Johnson flew the [[F-4 Phantom II]].\n\nIn 1966, while flying his 25th combat mission in [[Vietnam]], he was shot down over [[North Vietnam]]. He was a [[prisoner of war]] for seven years, including 42 months in solitary confinement. During this period, he was repeatedly [[torture]]d.\n\nJohnson was part of a group of about 11 prisoners known as the [[Alcatraz Gang]], a group of prisoners separated from other captives for their resistance to their captors. They were held in \"Alcatraz\", a special facility about one mile away from the [[H\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison]], notably nicknamed the \"Hanoi Hilton\". Johnson, like the others, was kept in solitary confinement, locked nightly in [[Legcuffs|irons]] in a 3-by-9-foot cell with the light on around the clock.<ref>Adams, Lorraine.
