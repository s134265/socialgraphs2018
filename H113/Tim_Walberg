Walberg. His paternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/walberg.htm|title=tim walberg|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He left a post-high school position with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] to pursue higher education. At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at [[Western Illinois University]] and attended [[Moody Bible Institute]], and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in religious education from [[Taylor University]]. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in [[New Haven, Indiana]], which concluded when he enrolled in the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] graduate school. After receiving an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in communications in 1978, Walberg and his young family relocated to [[Franklin Township, Lenawee County, Michigan|Tipton, Michigan]], where he led services at Union Gospel Church. He resigned his pastorship in 1982 in preparation for a successful bid for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]].\n\n==Michigan legislature==\nWalberg served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1998. He was succeeded by [[Doug Spade]] and the seat is currently held by [[Dudley Spade]], both Democrats. Walberg also spent time as a pastor and as a division manager for the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] while continuing to live in Michigan.<ref>[http://www.hillsdale.net/stories/042206//news_2006042200121.shtml Hillsdale.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n;2004\nAfter six years out of politics, Walberg ran in a field of six candidates in the 2004 Republican primary for the 7th District after six-term incumbent [[Nick Smith (U.S. politician)|Nick Smith]] retired.  He lost to former [[Michigan Senate|State Senator]] [[Joe Schwarz]], a moderate Republican.
