Police investigation as reported by local media indicated that both the child's mother and her boyfriend were involved with drugs. The baby's father lived out of state. Although not related to the child, the Cramers were able to have themselves made temporary guardians of the child. Previously authorities had briefly placed the child with its maternal grandmother, and also are stated in court records as having \"misplaced\" contact information for the baby's father. As a result, the baby's father was not notified of court hearings and did not participate in proceedings resulting in placing the child with the Cramers, and his parental rights were legally terminated. On December 3, 2010, the state supreme court heard arguments with regard to an appeal of the termination by the baby's father.<ref>[http://www.ndcourts.com/Calendar/]</ref>\n\nHe is married to Kris, and has five children.<ref>[http://pc6.psc.state.nd.us/commission/cramer.html Public Service Commission, North Dakota: Tony Clark, Commissioner<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://cramer.house.gov/ Congressman Kevin Cramer] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.kevincramer.org/ Kevin Cramer for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/North_Dakota/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives}}\n*{{CongLinks | congbio = C001096 | ballot = Kevin_Cramer | nndb = 988/000366887 | votesmart = 444 | govtrack = 412555 | opencong = 412555 | rollcall = 3109 | politifact = | fec = H6ND00074 | opensecrets = N00004614 | assets = |  legistorm = | followthemoney = 12990 | ontheissues = House/Kevin_Cramer.htm | congress = kevin-cramer/2144 | worldcat = lccn-n2006-90495 | c-span = kevincramer02 | imdb = | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = 6a855e58-4bbb-11e2-8758-b64a2997a921 }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box |\nbefore = [[Leo M.
