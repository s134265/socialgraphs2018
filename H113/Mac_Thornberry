He has served since 1995, when the House seated its first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority in forty years. \n\nA Republican, Thornberry represents {{ushr|TX|13}}, a  [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] stronghold which stretches between the [[Oklahoma]] and [[New Mexico]] borders. It winds across the Panhandle into the [[South Plains]], then runs east across the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] Valley. Covering over {{convert|40000|sqmi|km2}}, it is the second-largest district geographically in Texas and one of the largest (excluding at-large districts in [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], and [[Alaska]]) in the country. It is even larger in area than thirteen states. The principal cities in the district are [[Amarillo]] and [[Wichita Falls]].\n\n==Early life, Education and Career==\nHis great-great-grandfather, Amos Thornberry, a [[Union Army]] veteran and staunch Republican, moved in the 1880s to [[Clay County, Texas|Clay County]], just east of Wichita Falls. A year after Amos died in 1925, his son bought the cattle ranch that Mac Thornberry, his brothers, and their father now run.<ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/member/494#biography</ref>\n\nThornberry is a lifelong resident of [[Clarendon, Texas|Clarendon]],  some 60 miles (97&nbsp;km) east of Amarillo, in the heart of the 13th. His family has operated a [[ranch]] in the area since 1881. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[history]] from [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. He then obtained his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref>http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000238</ref> \n\nHe served previously as a staffer to two other Texas Republican congressmen, [[Tom Loeffler]] and [[Larry Combest]], and as deputy Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs under [[Ronald Reagan]] before he joined his brothers on the family ranch. He also practiced law in Amarillo. \n\nThornberry is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].<ref>CFR Membership List as of May 23, 2012.

He also serves as a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.<ref>[http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/emerging-threats-and-capabilities.]</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2013 POLITICO article, Thornberry is considered by most defense industry experts and House insiders to be the front runner to be the next chairman of the Armed Services Committee.<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/buck-mckeon-retirement-rumors-spark-jockeying-for-chairman-90976.html</ref> Thornberry has called massive cuts in defense spending preferable to any additional tax revenues.<ref>[http://defense.aol.com/2013/01/30/rep-thornberry-hill-fights-mean-sequestration-happens-then-we/ \"Rep.

Mac Thornberry on Military Reform.\"]</ref>\n\n==Legislative Work==\n\n===Legislative Biography===\n\nFrom the [http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/member/494#biography National Journal Congressional Almanac]:\n\n\"In the House, Thornberry has compiled a solidly conservative voting record, though he has a pragmatic streak and is hardly the most ideological Republican in the Texas delegation. In keeping with his scholarly nature, his official website includes an essay explaining his philosophy and explaining his interest 'in continuing to push government to work smarter and more efficiently.'\n\nThornberry has often been at the forefront of security issues. In 2002, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, he played a key role in the establishment of the new Homeland Security Department. He took over in January 2011 as chairman of the Armed Services Committee\u2019s terrorism panel, and Speaker John Boehner also asked him to lead an effort to develop a cyber security strategy for the country. Earlier, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, Thornberry criticized delays in integrating computer networks and intelligence analyses at the Homeland Security Department. He also has championed missile defense and called for better coordination of military space programs.\n\nThornberry was critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s arms control deal with Russia in 2010 for precluding the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear nations. But he can be more pragmatic than other defense hawks. He served on a bipartisan commission in 2007 that drew up recommendations for winning the war in Iraq with both lethal and non-lethal approaches, such as diplomacy and foreign aid. Despite his expertise on security matters, he lost his bid in 2009 to chair the full Armed Services Committee to Buck McKeon, R-Calif., who had more seniority.\n\nOn domestic issues, Thornberry has pressed for repeal of the estate tax and also tax credits to encourage production of oil in marginal wells. In 2010, he got a bill into law expanding access to state veterans\u2019 homes to parents whose children died while serving in the military. He introduced a bill in January 2011 to help states set up special health care courts staffed by judges with expertise in the subject. The judges would serve as an alternative to juries that Republicans say are inclined to award unnecessarily large damage amounts in malpractice cases.\"<ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/member/494#biography</ref>\n\n===Term Limits===\nThornberry has consistently voted for term limits that would apply to U.S. Congressmen.  He has never said that he would limit the amount of terms he would serve until a Constitutional Amendment is passed limiting senators and representatives across the board.  He is quoted as saying, \"The key is who are we working for? It doesn't matter if you've been in Washington two years or 25 years.  We saw a huge number of incumbents lose in the last election because they forgot that. I don't work for the new speaker. I don't work for the party. I work for the 650,000 folks in my district. That's certainly the focus of mine.\"<ref>http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2011-01-30/mac-has-voted-limits-over-course-9-terms</ref>\n\n===Agriculture and Farm Bill===\n\nWith a long personal and family background in ranching, Thornberry has been a leading voice in the House of Representatives about the importance of passing a Farm Bill every five years to give farmers and ranchers more stability.<ref>http://amarillo.com/opinion/editorial/2013-07-06/farm-bill-brings-crop-problems</ref>  In 2013, he voted for the five year Farm Bill that failed in the House.<ref>http://m.lubbockonline.com/agriculture/2013-06-20/house-rejects-farm-bill-62-republicans-vote-no-area-leaders-vote-yes</ref>  \n\nThe 2013 Farm Bill offered taxpayers close to $40 billion in savings, including reductions in farm policy spending and the repeal or consolidation of over 100 programs.<ref>http://agriculture.house.gov/sites/republicans.agriculture.house.gov/files/farm%20bill/h1947asorderedreported.pdf</ref> Those savings included annual cuts of $2 billion from food stamps, which would have been the most extensive reforms to food policy since 1996.<ref>http://m.lubbockonline.com/agriculture/2013-06-20/house-rejects-farm-bill-62-republicans-vote-no-area-leaders-vote-yes</ref>\n\n==Voting Record==\nFrom Jan 1995 to May 2013, Thornberry missed 124 of 12,475 roll call votes, which is 1.0%. This is better than the median of 2.3% among the lifetime records of representatives currently serving.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/mac_thornberry/400404</ref>\n\n===Voting Scorecard by Issue===\n* In 2012 the American Conservative Union Ratings of Congress gave Thornberry a 96% rating for the year. He has a lifetime score of 95%.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/21706/mac-thornberry#.UZ0LorWPPn8</ref> \n* \n* The National Right to Life Committee has consistently scored Thornberry at 100%.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/21706/mac-thornberry#.UZ0MC7WPPn9</ref>\n* \n* The National Rifle Association gave Thornberry a lifetime rating of 92% on 2nd Amendment and gun rights issues.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/21706/mac-thornberry#.UZ0SYbWPPn8</ref>\n* \n* The Disabled American Veterans and Vietnam Veterans of America have both given Thornberry a 100% score.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/21706/mac-thornberry#.UZ0NvLWPPn-</ref>\n* \n* Both the Fleet Reserve Association and Non Commissioned Officers Association have given Thornberry a 100% score.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/21706/mac-thornberry#.UZ0NvLWPPn-</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nThornberry defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Bill Sarpalius]] in the 1994 [[general election]], a heavily Republican year nationwide. He polled 79,416 votes (55.41 percent) to Sarpalius' 63,923 votes (44.18 percent). Two years earlier in a much higher turnout election, Sarpalius had polled nearly double the votes that he received in 1994. The 13th District has always been a somewhat conservative district, but Thornberry's victory is still regarded as an upset.\n\nSince his initial election, Thornberry has consolidated his hold on the district and routinely wins by large majorities in an area that was historically Democratic as recently as the 1970s. Thornberry is only the third Republican to represent the district since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The previous Republican representatives were [[Robert \"Bob\" Price|Robert D. \"Bob\" Price]] of [[Pampa, Texas|Pampa]] (1967\u20131975) and [[Beau Boulter]] of Amarillo (1985\u20131989).\n\nIn the 2006 and 2008 elections, Thornberry handily defeated former [[intelligence officer]] and Professor Roger Waun. \n\nIn the Republican primary held on May 29, 2012, Thornberry overwhelmed his lone opponent, Pamela Lee Barlow, 47,251 votes (77.6 percent) to 13,643 (22.4 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may29_160_state.htm|title=Republican primary election returns, May 29, 2012|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> In the general election, Thornberry bested (91 percent) Libertarian John Robert Deek of Denton and Green Party candidate Keith F. Houston of [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]] (there was no Democratic candidate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2012/nov/06/big-country-reps-will-keep-their-jobs/?print=1|title=Big Country reps will keep their jobs, November 6, 2012|publisher=http://www.reporternews.com|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014, Thornberry easily won re-nomination to an eleventh term in Congress. He polled 45,097 votes (67.92 percent) to challengers Elaine Hays and, again, Pamela Barlow, who received 12,438 votes (18.7 percent) and 8,860 votes (13.3 percent), respectively.<ref>{{cite
