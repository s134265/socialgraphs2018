After graduating, he worked as a lawyer. He was elected to the [[California Assembly]] in 1969 and served three terms. Along with Congressman [[Howard Berman]], Waxman co-founded the [[Los Angeles County Young Democrats]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lowenfeld|first1=Jonah|title=California\u2019s new citizen-led redistricting panel could force two Jewish Democrats into a face-off|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/californias_new_citizen-led_redistricting_panel_could_force_two_jewish_demo|accessdate=21 August 2014|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=2011-07-19}}</ref>\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1974, Democratic congressman [[Chet Holifield]] retired after 16 terms in Congress.  Waxman gave up his state assembly seat to run for the district, which had been renumbered from the 19th to the 24th in a mid-decade redistricting. Waxman won the Democratic nomination for the district, and easily won the general election, as this was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Democratic district. He has been re-elected 17 times with no substantive opposition. He faced no major-party opposition in 1986, and was completely unopposed in 2008. His district has changed numbers four times in his tenure\u2014from the 24th (1975\u20131993) to the 29th (1993\u20132003) to the 30th (2003\u20132012) to the 33rd (2012). He is one of two surviving members of the large Democratic freshman class of 1975, along with [[George Miller (politician)|George Miller]] of California.\n\nWaxman's most recent district (until 2012), [[California's 30th congressional district]], included [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[Agoura Hills, California|Agoura Hills]], [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], [[Hidden Hills, California|Hidden Hills]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], and [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] as well as such areas of western Los Angeles as [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]], [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax]], [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades]], [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]], [[Beverlywood, Los Angeles, California|Beverlywood]], [[Topanga, California|Topanga]], [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]], [[Palms, Los Angeles, California|Palms]], [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], [[West Hills, Los Angeles, California|West Hills]], [[Westside Village, Los Angeles, California|Westside Village]], [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills]], but through the creation of a new 33rd Congressional District by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, in the November 2012 general election Waxman won re-election<ref name=\"2012election\">http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/266603-waxman-fights-off-independent-opponent</ref> in an area including his home community of Beverly Hills and stretching to Malibu and Pacific-coastal communities heading south including Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Northwest San Pedro.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marroquin|first=Art|title=House veteran Waxman will run in new district that includes South Bay|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_18774324|newspaper=The Daily Breeze|date=29 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nBefore the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 1995, Waxman was a powerful figure in the House as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce#Subcommittees|Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment]] from 1979. In this role he conducted investigations into a range of health and environmental issues, including universal health insurance, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] coverage, [[AIDS]] and air and water pollution.  In 1994, Waxman forced the chief executives of the seven major tobacco companies to swear under oath that [[nicotine]] was not addictive.<ref name=\"1994 Tobacco Transcript\">{{cite web|title=Inside the Tobacco Deal|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/settlement/timelines/april94.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nWaxman's stated legislative priorities are health and environmental issues. These include universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, tobacco, AIDS, air and water quality standards, pesticides, nursing home quality standards, women's health research and reproductive rights, the availability and cost of prescription drugs, and the right of communities to know about pollution levels.  As an example of Waxman's thoughts regarding tobacco, on April 13, 2010, he requested that [[Major League Baseball]] ban smokeless tobacco in all its various forms - [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], [[dipping tobacco]]. [[chewing tobacco]], [[snus]], etc.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 26, 2010 |title=For the Record: Requested |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |volume=112 |issue=18 |page=16 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=McDonell |editor1-link=Terry McDonell }}</ref>\n\nWith the Democrats' victory in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], Waxman became chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight and Government Reform Committee]], the principal investigative committee of the House. He was the committee's ranking Democrat from 1997 to 2007.  In 1998, while he was still ranking member, he created a \"Special Investigations Division\" to investigate matters that he felt the full committee had neglected. This was possible because the committee has broad powers to investigate any matter with federal policy implications, even if another committee has jurisdiction over it.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20051215014917 |url=www.democrats.reform.house.gov/investigations.asp |title=Special Investigations }}. democrats.reform.house.gov.

If a statement was an accurate reflection of U.S. intelligence at the time it was made, it was excluded even if it now appears erroneous.\n\nIn 2006, Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Waxman with its Good Government Award for his various contributions to government transparency and oversight.<ref>[http://www.pogo.org/honorees/good-government-award/ Good Government Award Home Page.] Project On Government Oversight Website. Retrieved July 1, 2010.</ref>\n\nOn the day after the 2006 elections, Waxman directed his aides to draw up an \"oversight plan\" for the panel. He had already let it be known that he wanted to investigate [[Halliburton]], as well as its alleged malfeasance related to government contracts in [[Iraq]]. It is very likely that he could also investigate the numerous scandals surrounding [[Jack Abramoff]]. This led to concerns among Democratic aides that the Government Reform Committee under Waxman would stage a repeat of the committee's performance under the [[Clinton administration]], when it issued over 1,000 subpoenas. However, Waxman told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that he is interested in accountability and not retaliation.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15675859/site/newsweek/page/3/ Democrats\u2019 Challenge: Stay in the Center \u2013 Newsweek National News \u2013 MSNBC.com]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, he began serving as the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce Committee]] after defeating Chairman [[John Dingell]] in a 137\u2013122 secret vote of House Democrats on November 20, 2008.\n\nWaxman is proud of his \"strong Jewish identity\" and has drawn political conclusions from his exploration of the religion.<ref name=trojanWaxman /> \"Judaism is about acting and doing the right thing, not simply believing in it or mindlessly following ritual\", he said in a speech presented by the [[University of Southern California]]'s Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life.<ref name=trojanWaxman>{{cite news\n| first = Gretchen\n| last = Meier\n| url = http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2006/04/24/News/Congressman.Lambastes.Bush.Republicans.On.Ethical.Issues-1866412.shtml\n| publisher = [[Daily Trojan]]\n| title = Congressman lambastes Bush, Republicans on ethical issues\n| date = 2006-04-24\n| accessdate = 2006-12-15\n|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070504013353/http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2006/04/24/News/Congressman.Lambastes.Bush.Republicans.On.Ethical.Issues-1866412.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-04}}</ref> Waxman said he applies Jewish ethical values to his congressional service.
