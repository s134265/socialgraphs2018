The nonpartisan [[League of Conservation Voters]] gave Chabot a grade of 10% for the 109th Congress, noting that he voted \"anti-environment\" on 11 out of 12 issues selected by that organization as crucial; his lifetime grade from the LCV is 23%.<ref>[http://www.lcv.org/images/client/pdfs/LCV_2006_Scorecard_final.pdf League of Conservation Voters 2006 National Scorecard]</ref>\n\nIn June 2007, Chabot sponsored an amendment to block federally funded road building in Tongass National Forest. Proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in Tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers, costing some $30 million annually, and noted that the Forest Service faces an estimated $900 million road maintenance backlog in the forest. Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]]. Of the bill, Representative Chabot said \"I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime...But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job.

All five organizations have members on their board of directors who are also members of Chabot's inner circle of contributors and fundraisers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nGary Lindgren, Chabot's chief of staff, said that \"there's not a connection\" between the donations and the earmarks. Lindgren said the earmarks are for major institutions where it would be expected that board members would be politically active. \"You could look at almost any district, and the people who sit on boards of museums and institutions will be wealthy and donate to campaigns\", said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste. Schatz noted that Chabot has won high marks from CAGW in the past.<ref>Jonathan Allen, [http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/091906/chabot.html \"Chabot aims earmarks at places linked to donors\"], ''The Hill'', September 19, 2006</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]'''\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific|Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific]]\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia|Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia]] (Chairman)\n*'''[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]]'''\n**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution|Subcommittee on the Constitution]]\n**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet|Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Small Business|Committee on Small Business]]'''\n\n==Electoral history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ {{ushr|Ohio|1|}}: Results 1988, 1994&ndash;2012<ref name=\"clerkresults\">{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html|title=Election Statistics |accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives}}</ref><ref>http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/Research/electResultsMain/2012Results.aspx</ref>\n!|Year\n!\n!|Winner\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|Runner-up\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|3rd Party\n!|Party\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|3rd Party\n!|Party\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n|-\n|[[U.S. House election, 1988|1988]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |'''[[Thomas A.
