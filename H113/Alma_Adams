C. Stafford in the Democratic primary. Stafford was a perennial candidate that had run for various offices, sometimes as a Democrat and other times as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. He previously had challenged Gist as a Republican in the 1992 general election. In 1994, running as a Democrat,<ref>{{cite news|title=O. C. Stafford: Running as a Democrat|newspaper=Greensboro News and Record|date=January 27, 1994|page=B8}}</ref> he was defeated by Adams in the primary.

Adams was one of the first to announce that if Watt were confirmed, she would run in the ensuing special election.  After Watt was confirmed in December, Adams formally filed paperwork to run in both the Democratic primary for a full two-year term in the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]] and the [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district special election, 2014|special election]] for the balance of Watt's 11th term.<ref name=kickoff>{{cite web|last=Cahn |first=Emily |url=http://atr.rollcall.com/watt-confirmation-kicks-off-north-carolina-special-election/ |title=Roll Call: Watt Confirmation Kicks Off North Carolina Special Election |publisher=Atr.rollcall.com |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was initially thought that Adams was at a geographic disadvantage in the five-way primary for both the special and regular elections (held on the same day).  Adams is from Greensboro, but the bulk of the district's population is in Charlotte.  However, the three Charlotteans in the race split that region's vote.  This allowed Adams to win both primaries with approximately 44 percent of the vote, a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold to avoid a [[two-round system|runoff]].  She faced Republican Vince Coakley, a former television and radio broadcaster from Matthews, in both the general and special elections, which were held on the same day in November.  However, the 12th is a heavily Democratic district with a majority-black voting population and a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+26, and Adams was overwhelmingly favored in the general election. \n\nAdams is the second woman of color to represent North Carolina in the House.  The first was [[Eva Clayton]], who represented much of eastern North Carolina from 1992 to 2002.\n\n==Legislative career==\nAdams was previously a member of the Greensboro City School Board from 1984 to 1986 and a Greensboro City Council member from 1987 until her appointment to the house seat in 1994.<ref name=NCManual /><ref name=\"Gist seat\" />\n\nIn 2008, Adams was elected to a second term as chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.<ref>[http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/adams_to_chair_black_caucus_again News & Observer: Adams to chair Black Caucus again]</ref>\n\nShe was vice-chair of the Government Committee in the state House<ref>{{cite web|title=Committee Assignments 2013-2014|url=http://www.legislature.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/reports/committeeAssignments.pl?nUserid=18&Chamber=H|publisher=North Carolina General Assembly|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> and previously has been chair of the Appropriations Committee as well as vice-chair of the Commerce, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.<ref name=NCManual />\n\n==Other work==\nAdams has been a professor of art at [[Bennett College]], in Greensboro as well as the director of the Steel Hall Art Gallery.<ref name=NCManual />\n\nIn 1990, Adams helped co-found, with Eva Hamlin Miller, the African American Atelier, an organization established to advance awareness and appreciation for visual arts and cultures of African Americans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://africanamericanatelier.org/about/background/|publisher=African American Atelier|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nShe is currently the chairperson of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation which gives out scholarships to students who are attending one of North Carolina's [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About the NCLBCF|url=http://nclbcf.org/2013/nclbcf|publisher=NC Legislative Black Caucus Foundation|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAdams is divorced, the mother of two children.<ref name=NCManual /><ref name=Beckwith /> She is well noted for the many distinctive hats that she wears.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hairston|first=Otis L., Jr|title=Black America Series: Greensboro, North Carolina|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=0-7385-1525-6}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://adams.house.gov/ Congresswoman Alma Adams] (official U.S. House site)\n{{Congbio|A000370}}\n*[http://almaadamsforcongress.com/ Adams official campaign website]\n*[http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/personBio.aspx?c=2 Civil Rights Greensboro]\n\n{{NC-FedRep}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              =Adams, Alma S.\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =Adams, Alma Shealey (full name)\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =North Carolina politician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =May 27, 1946\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[High Point, North Carolina]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adams, Alma S.}}\n[[Category:African-American members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:African-American women in politics]]\n[[Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:North Carolina Democrats]]\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Women state legislators in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ohio State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]"}]}}}}
