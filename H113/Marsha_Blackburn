The 6th District [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] Congressman, [[Bart Gordon]], had faced three tough races in the 1990s, including a near-defeat in 1994, seemingly due to the 6th's inclusion of Williamson County, the wealthiest county in the state and the most Republican county in Middle Tennessee. It appeared that the Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly wanted to protect Gordon by moving Williamson County into the already heavily Republican 7th District.<ref>{{cite news |title=2011 Redistricting TN |date=2010-01-12 |work=TN Precinct Project |url=http://www.tnprecinctproject.com/2010/01/12/2011-redistricting-tn/ |first=KENT |last=DAVIS}}</ref> To maintain approximately equal district sizes (as required by [[Wesberry v. Sanders|Wesberry v. Sanders \u2013 1964]]) and to compensate for the increase in 7th District population by the addition of Williamson County, the General Assembly shifted some of the more Democratic parts of [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] to the nearby 8th District. This created a district that is 200 miles long, but in some parts of Middle Tennessee is only two miles wide\u2014roughly the width of a highway lane as depicted on a map. According to ''Memphis Magazine'', the [[gerrymander|gerrymandered district]] \"stretches in reptilian fashion... from the suburbs of Memphis to those of western Nashville\".<ref name=Baker/>\n \nIn 2002, 7th District incumbent Republican congressman [[Ed Bryant]] decided to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Fred Thompson]]. Blackburn entered the primary to replace Bryant. The party realignment from conservative Democratic, or \"[[Dixiecrat]]ic,\" to Republican occurred largely due to conservative white reaction to 1960s developments such as [[Civil Rights]] and, among evangelical Christian residents particularly, the outlawing of [[school prayer]], as well as perceived attacks upon Southern white culture. Nearly all the rural counties, but also many Memphis and Nashville suburbanites hold a political worldview similar to the district's neighbors in places like [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]]. Despite the heavy presence of [[African Americans]] in some rural parts of the district east of Memphis, black political activity is nowhere as effective as that in Tennessee's two largest cities. Even if that were not the case, their numbers are insufficient to overcome the white majority.\n\nOf the four serious candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs, while the other three were all from Memphis and its suburbs. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, allowing her to win the primary by 20 points. Her primary win was [[tantamount to election]] in November.  In the general election, she defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron.  She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but the first not to serve as a stand-in for her husband. ([[Irene Baker|Irene Bailey Baker]] and [[Louise Reece]] had served as [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]]s after their husbands died in office, and [[Marilyn Lloyd]] replaced her husband on the ballot when he died after the primary election.)  She is also the first Republican to represent part of Nashville since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. A small portion of Nashville, roughly co-extensive with the Davidson County portion of the state senate district, was shifted from the heavily Democratic 5th District to the 7th District after the 2000 Census.\n\nShe ran unopposed for reelection in 2004, which is somewhat unusual for a freshman member of Congress, even from a district as heavily Republican as the 7th. ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'''s September 2004 [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/best-worst-of-congress/ \"Best and Worst of Congress\"], obtained from a survey of Congressional aides, identified her as one of the three best freshman members.  She has been reelected four more times with only nominal opposition.  Redistricting after the 2010 census made the district more compact and suburban; it lost its shares of Nashville and Memphis.\n\n=== Political positions ===\nBlackburn is a fiscal and social conservative.
