Peters resigned as state lottery commissioner to devote his full energy to the campaign.\n\nKnollenberg was considered vulnerable due to an increasing Democratic trend in what was once a heavily Republican district.

As a result of the subsequent redistricting of house seats, much of Peters' 9th district, including his home in Bloomfield Hills, was merged with the [[Michigan's 12th congressional district|12th district]], represented by fellow Democrat [[Sandy Levin]].  The new district retained Peters' district number\u2014the 9th\u2014but geographically was more Levin's district.\n\nIn September 2011, Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn 14th District.  The district had previously been the 13th District, represented by freshman Democrat [[Hansen Clarke]].  The redrawn district is based in Detroit, but contains a large chunk of Peters' old State Senate district and portions of his old congressional district.  Indeed, Peters had represented most of the Oakland County portion of the district at one time or another.  Due to Detroit's dwindling population, it was no longer possible to keep the district exclusively within [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]].  In the August 2012 Democratic primary, he defeated Clarke (who opted to follow most of his constituents into the reconfigured 14th even though his home had been drawn into the reconfigured 13th\u2014the old 14th) and Southfield Mayor [[Brenda Lawrence]].  The 14th is a heavily Democratic, 58 percent black-majority district, and Peters was overwhelmingly favored in November.
