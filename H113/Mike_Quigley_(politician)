This bill, proposed as an amendment to the [[Patriot Act]], came under fire from House Republicans Reps. [[James Sensenbrenner Jr.]] of Wisconsin and [[Louie Gohmert]] of Texas who argued that this would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of those mistakenly placed on the Terrorist Watch List.

Quigley also voted for increases in government spending on physical and occupational therapy.\n\n;Environment\nA [[Sierra Club]] member since high school, Quigley initially joined politics because of his desire to help the environment through legislation. Quigley has enacted this desire through supporting the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], a 2009 bill to create an emissions trading plan which passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] but was defeated in the Senate.
