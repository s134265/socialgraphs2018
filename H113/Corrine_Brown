Sissoko, a friend of Congresswoman Brown, had been imprisoned in Miami after pleading guilty to charges of bribing a customs officer. Brown had worked to secure his release, pressuring U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] to deport Sissoko back to his homeland as an alternative to continued incarceration. The Project held this violated the House gift rule, but Brown denied she had acted improperly. The congressional subcommittee investigating Brown found insufficient evidence to issue a Statement of Alleged Violation, but said she had acted with poor judgment in connection with Sissoko.<ref name=\"lyonscheck\"/><ref>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:MmW84qdNr_AJ:ethics.house.gov/Media/PDF/Press%2520StatementCorrineBrownend.pdf+%2B%22corrine+brown%22+site:ethics.house.gov&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi8Gz_RHqEEBRCmDnQ5fWh7ol0GUtiI0M4GlTMfegkAUaKpXRN23BmGmHo8UsQ77voYt5T09hb8USWMy-TgU6MR91_iNQQfygBucYM9edWmO-TAtmKStM4ErAB2lgRxiqFZsrVd&sig=AHIEtbQLcJIgDY6hV5Z_JbvP0w4HhPmL8w Ethics Report Press Release]; House.Ethics.Gov; September 21, 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.house.gov/ethics/Press_Statement_CorrineBrownend.html \"Statement of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct  in the Matter of Representative Corrine Brown\"] (September 21, 2000).
