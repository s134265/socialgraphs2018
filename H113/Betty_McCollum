The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent, State Senator [[Linda Runbeck]], but [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.\n\nIn 2008, McCollum endorsed Barack Obama for president.\n\n==Electoral
