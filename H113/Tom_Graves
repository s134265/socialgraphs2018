He came in first but fell short of the requisite 50% plus one majority in order to avoid a runoff and would once again face Hawkins in the primary runoff.  This was the fourth time Graves faced Hawkins as an opponent in both the special and general primaries along with their respective runoffs.  The 9th district is so heavily Republican that whoever won the runoff was all but assured of winning a full term. Graves won the primary runoff on August 10, 2010.  He won the November 2, 2010 general election unopposed.\n\n;2012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2012#District 14}}\nAfter redistricting, Graves' home in Ranger was drawn into the newly created [[Georgia's 14th congressional district|14th district]], which is basically the northwestern portion of the old 9th.

Attorneys for Graves argued that the bank had been at fault for loaning him money that they knew he couldn't repay, making the signed personal guarantees invalid. Graves and his partner were no longer involved with the company used to take out the loan after transferring ownership to another party in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/attorney-for-graves-rogers-1095615.html|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=August 11, 2011 |title=Attorney for Graves, Rogers: Bank is at fault|author=Jeremy Redmon and Aaron Gould Sheinin }}</ref> The new owner (the hotel's former manager) agreed to purchase the company and its real estate and debt from Graves and Rogers for $10,000 but says they never actually required him to pay them anything.<ref>{{cite news|title=Failed motel could cost taxpayers $100,000|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2011/aug/21/a1-failed-motel-could-cost-taxpayers-100000/|accessdate=October 7, 2011|newspaper=Chattanooga Times Free Press|date=August 21, 2011|author=Andy Johns}}</ref> The default on Graves' loan contributed significantly to the collapse of the  Bartow County Bank (the small community bank which loaned the $2.2 million to Graves). The bank's collapse and liquidation cost the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] $69.5 million.  According to Morgan Akin (the former bank chairman), he only approved the loan to Graves and Rodgers because, \"They were well-respected members of the community, and we took that into account,\" and he never imagined such prominent political figures would default.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former bank chair: Tich loan complications contributed to bank collapse|url=http://www.calhountimes.com/view/full_story/15255696/article-Former-bank-chair--Tich-loan--complications-contributed-to-bank-collapse?|accessdate=October 6, 2011|newspaper=Calhoun Times|date=August 31, 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, although Graves and Rogers claimed the new owner of the company only defaulted on the loan because the bank reneged on a promise to refinance, the bank countered that the loan was in default before the sale of their company and they invalidated their refinancing deal because they sold the company without informing the bank.
