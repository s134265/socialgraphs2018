Retrieved October 25, 2007.</ref> She graduated from [[Texas Wesleyan University]]. She was elected to the [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] city council in 1989 and was elected Mayor in 1991.\n\nAfter the retirement of Congressman [[Pete Geren]] in 1996, both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties worked to recruit Granger. Republicans were particularly bullish on their chances of winning the 12th.  It had once been represented by Democratic [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Jim Wright]], but had been made significantly more affluent and Republican after the 1990 census.  Granger made the decision to run as a Republican, much to the dismay of local [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] activists, who criticized Granger as being too liberal. She was elected by a wide margin, taking 56 percent of the vote over the Democrat [[Hugh Parmer]], also a former Fort Worth mayor.  She was handily reelected in 1998 and has only faced serious opposition once\u2014in 2000.  In 2008, Granger defeated Democratic challenger Tracey Smith with 67 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2006, Granger was reelected to serve her sixth term in Congress. She was also elected [[Republican Conference Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Conference Vice Chair]], the fourth-ranking position among House Republicans, in November 2006. She is currently Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Subcommitee on State-Foreign Operations. She also sits on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]]'s [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|Subcommittee on Defense]] (the first woman to do so), and the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies|Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education Subcommittee]].

A school named for Granger's mother - Mullendore Elementary - was opened several years earlier in [[North Richland Hills, Texas]].
