According to a local newspaper, the [[Daily Local News]], Gerlach charged that his opponent was \"out of touch\" with his constituency.\n\nGerlach proposed expanding open-space preservation by using zoning laws to encourage developers to incorporate open space into development projects, along with the creation of environmental protection authorities.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Rellahan\n  | first = Michael\n  | title = James Gerlach seeks office with a drive of a running back\n  | work = [[Daily Local News]]\n  | date = October 30, 1990\n  }}</ref>\n\nDuring the election, Gerlach's Democratic opponents accused the Western Pennsylvania native of moving to [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] for the sole purpose of running against Morris.
