Serrano, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York]], represents a district that is one of the smallest in the country geographically, consisting of a few miles of the heavily urbanized and populated [[South Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. His district is also one of the most densely populated and one of the few majority Hispanic districts in the country. The district was numbered the {{ushr|NY|18|18th}} from 1990 to 1993 and the {{ushr|NY|16|16th}} from 1993 to 2013; it has been the {{ushr|NY|15|15th district}} since 2013.\n\n==Early life, education, and military service==\nSerrano was born in [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico]]. At the age of seven, Serrano was taken by his family to [[The Bronx]], where he was raised in the Millbrook Houses. Serrano went to Grace Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx and then attended [[Lehman College]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] medical corps from 1964 to 1966.\n\n==New York Assembly==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1976, he ran for the [[New York Assembly]] in the 75th District. In the Democratic primary, he defeated Rafael Castaneira Colon 70%-30%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=255481 Ourcampaigns.com]</ref> He won the general election with 91%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=132949 Ourcampaigns.com]</ref> He never won re-election with less than 92% of the vote. His district was renumbered the 73rd after the [[1980 United States Census]].\n\n===Committee assignments===\nHe served as Chairman of the Consumer Affairs Committee and the Education Committee.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1990, Serrano won a special election for the seat vacated by resigning U.S. Congressman [[Robert Garc\u00eda]] with 92% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=107262 Ourcampaigns.com]</ref> He has never won re-election with less than 92% of the vote,<ref>[http://www.collegetermpapers.com/TermPapers/Government_&_Politics/Political_Profile_of_Jose_Serrano.shtml Collegetermpapers.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.bronxnewsnetwork.org/2010/11/bronx-general-election-results.html Bronxnewsnetwork.org]</ref> in what is considered one of the safest seats in Congress.\n\nIn 2004, Congressman Serrano faced an electoral challenge from Jose Serrano, an unemployed former loading dockworker with the same name who eventually dropped out of the race in July.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/24/nyregion/seeing-double-on-ballot-similar-names-sow-confusion.html]</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\n\nSerrano has consistently supported initiatives to resolve Puerto Rico's political status problem, including the 1998 Young bill, which he coauthored, and the December 22, 2005, report of the [[President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status]], which recommends that Congress provide an opportunity for residents in Puerto Rico to vote for or against its current status, which the report describes as an unincorporated U.S. territory and Serrano describes as a U.S. colony. Serrano filed a bill, HR 900, with Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortu\u00f1o]], co-sponsored by 129 other Democratic and Republican members of Congress, to authorize such a referendum by 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arroyo |first=Phillip |url=http://prdemocratcorner.blogspot.com/2008/10/congressman-serranos-testimony-on-hr.html |title=PUERTO RICO DEMOCRAT CORNER: Congressman Serrano's testimony on HR 900 (April 2007) |publisher=Prdemocratcorner.blogspot.com |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>\n\nA member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus|Progressive Caucus]], he is widely regarded as one of the most Progressive members of Congress. He has been questioned about his [[pork barrel spending]] by some fiscal conservative members of Congress. [[Arizona]] Congressman [[Jeff Flake]] once said of Serrano's $150,000 [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] to repair the roof at the city-owned Arthur Avenue Market (a historic indoor produce and prepared food market in the Bronx's \"Little Italy\"), \"I would argue this is one [[cannoli]] the taxpayer doesn\u2019t want to take a bite of.\"<ref name=\"60minutes\">CBS ''60 Minutes'', [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/02/60minutes/main2145860.shtml ''Rep.

I make no excuses about the fact that I earmark dollars to go in the poorest congressional district in the nation, which is situated in the richest city on earth.\"<ref name=\"60minutes\"/>\n\nOn November 18, 2005, he was one of three votes in favor of immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. The other two votes were from [[Cynthia McKinney]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Robert Wexler]] of [[Florida]].<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/1526209 Rep.

This has been met with heavily negative backlash in social media, including a flood of so-called \"hateful\" comments on his Facebook page.\n\nSerrano has paid attention to local environmental issues in New York, with a particular focus on constructing greenways, acquiring parklands, and cleaning up the Bronx River, which runs through his district.  Recently a beaver was discovered swimming in the river for the first time in 200 years, something seen as a testament to his efforts.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/nyregion/23beaver.html?_r=1&ei=5070&en=2ad9892ebc5bdc86&ex=1190088000&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1190442846-peEVm1IxNq5hjoihc46nkQ After 200 Years, a Beaver Is Back in New York City]</ref>  In 2007, he engineered the purchase of the last privately owned island in New York harbor\u2014[[South Brother Island, East River|South Brother Island]]\u2014for preservation in perpetuity by the City of New York as a wildlife refuge for rare shorebirds.\n\nSerrano was a critic of the Bush administration's approach to handling President [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] of Venezuela. In 2005, while the Venezuelan President was in New York City speaking before the United Nations, the congressman invited him to his district to speak to his constituency.\n\nSerrano is one of three New York-area congressmen on the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]], the others being [[Nita Lowey]] of the [[New York's 18th congressional district|18th District]] and [[Steve Rothman]] of [[New Jersey's 9th congressional district]] (which abuts New York City). He is the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services.  As chairman, he successfully engineered the inclusion of language in the 2007 omnibus spending bill that guarantees the extension of the [[50 State Quarters]] program to include the minting of 6 additional quarters to honor the District of Columbia and the 5 United States territories, including Serrano's native Puerto Rico.\n\nSerrano has also been an advocate for [http://www.pr-secretfiles.net Puerto Ricans under FBI prosecution]. In May 2000, he brokered an agreement with then-FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]], then [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] senator [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Orellana]] and then Puerto Rico Senate Federal Affairs Committee chairman [[Kenneth McClintock]], the islands' outgoing Senate President, that has resulted in the release of nearly 100,000 pages of previously secret FBI files on Puerto Rican political activists.\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Congressman [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Serrano|Serrano]] wrote condolences to Chavez via ''Twitter'' describing him as a leader who, \"understood the needs of the poor.
