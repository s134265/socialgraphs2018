He continued to serve in the Georgia House until his election to the U.S. House in 2005.\n\nAs Republican Leader in the Georgia House, he led the fight against intense partisan [[gerrymandering]] during the redistricting process controlled by the Democratic majority in 2001.

Westmoreland and his colleagues claimed that it was no longer fair to target their states, given the passage of time since 1965 and the changes their states had made to provide fair elections and voting.
