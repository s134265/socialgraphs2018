He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and is Ranking Member of the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].\n\nThe district covers parts of [[Baltimore County]], [[Anne Arundel County]], [[Harford County]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]] and [[Baltimore City]]. \n==Early life, education and career==\n\nRuppersberger was born in Baltimore, the son of Margaret \"Peggy\" (n\u00e9e Wilson) and Charles Albert \"Al\" Ruppersberger, Jr. He is of part [[German American|German descent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/ruppersberger.htm |title=dutch ruppersberger |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> Ruppersberger's legal first name is Dutch, a nickname since childhood. He graduated from [[Baltimore City College]] and attended the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where he played [[lacrosse]]. He earned his [[Juris Doctor|juris doctor]] (JD) from the [[University of Baltimore School of Law]].\n\nRuppersberger began his career as a [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]] Assistant State's Attorney. He was soon promoted to the Chief of the State's Attorney Office Investigative Division, pursuing [[organized crime]], [[political corruption]], and drug trafficking. He was elected to the Baltimore County Council in 1985 and again in 1989, chosen twice as council chairman. In December 1994 and again in 1998, Ruppersberger was elected [[Baltimore County Executive]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n[[Image:Ruppersberger intel director.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Congressman Ruppersberger calls on Congress to create a cabinet level intelligence director on August 3, 2004.]]\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]''' (Ranking Member)\n\n===Party leadership===\nRuppersberger was the first Democratic freshman ever to be appointed to the House Intelligence Committee.  He was named to this committee because his district is home to the [[National Security Agency]].  Since 2011, he has been this committee's ranking Democrat. The position places Ruppersberger on the elite \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which refers to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader, House speaker and House minority leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country's most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.\n\n===Shock Trauma ===\nCongressman Ruppersberger decided to run for office after a near-fatal car accident while investigating a drug trafficking case. Thanks to the dedication of doctors at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, Congressman Ruppersberger survived and began campaigning for office to assist Shock Trauma after they saved his life. He remains an active supporter of the hospital, serving as vice chairman of its board of visitors. He also serves on the United States Naval Academy Board of Visitors.\n\n===Operation Hero Miles===\nIn one of his first acts in Washington in 2003, Congressman Ruppersberger created the national \u201cHero Miles\u201d program to enable patriotic Americans to donate their frequent flyer miles to wounded warriors recovering at military or Veterans Administration (VA) medical centers as well as to friends and family visiting them. In 2012, he authored legislation expanding the program to enable Americans to also donate their hotel reward points to military families. Both the \u201cHero Miles\u201d and \u201cHotels for Heroes\u201d programs are administered by Fisher House, a nonprofit organization that opens its homes to military families visiting their injured loved ones at hospitals across the country \n.<ref name=wbal_tv>{{cite web|title=Ruppersberger Receives Medal For 'Operation Hero Miles'|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/travelgetaways/3853008/detail.html|work=[[WBAL-TV]]|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>  He won a [[Charles Dick Medal of Merit]] in 2004 for this initiative, thus becoming the last Marylander to win this award, which was previously awarded to U.S. Rep. Beverly Byron (1992), State Senator John Astle (1993), U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski (1994), U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (1998) and State Del (now State Comptroller) Peter Franchot (1999).\n\n===CISPA===\nCongressman Ruppersberger, along with Michigan Republican Mike Rogers, co-sponsored the [[Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act]], designed to increase intelligence sharing between private cyber security firms and government agencies.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/11/us-cybersecurity-congress-idUSBRE8391FY20120411 | work=Reuters | title=House to take up cybersecurity bill with revisions | date=April 11, 2012}}</ref> More than 60 businesses and trade organizations submitted letters of support including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Time Warner, Verizon and AT&T, IBM and Intel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intelligence.house.gov/hr-624-letters-support |title=H.R. 624 - Letters of Support &#124; The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence |publisher=Intelligence.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> Despite several amendments to address privacy concerns, some groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have criticized the act for a lack of civil liberties protections, claiming that it authorizes government surveillance of private communications and allows companies to hand over large amounts of personal information on their clients without a warrant or judicial oversight, and thereby creates a cybersecurity loophole in existing privacy laws, such as the Wiretap Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/cybersecurity-bill-faq-disturbing-privacy-dangers-cispa-and-how-you-stop-it |title=CISPA is Back: FAQ on What it is and Why it's Still Dangerous &#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> CISPA passed the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll192.xml</ref> It was reintroduced into the House on February 13, 2013, and passed on April 18, 2013, by a bipartisan vote of 288-127.

The [[Maryland General Assembly]] significantly altered the 2nd by shifting most of its share of Harford County to the 1st and 6th Districts. In its place, the legislature added a heavily Democratic portion of Baltimore City that had previously been in the 1st District. This turned the 2nd from a swing district into a strongly Democratic district.  It was an open secret that the district was drawn for Ruppersberger; local media called the new district \"the Dutch district.\"  An August 2011 editorial by [[The Washington Post]] describes the 2nd district as \"curlicue territories strung together by impossibly delicate tendrils of land\" and \"a crazy-quilt confection drawn for the express purpose of ousting the incumbent at the time, Rep. (and later Gov.) Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, and installing C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat who still holds the job.\"<ref name=wpostAug2011>{{cite news|title=Maryland Democrats redraw the congressional district map|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/maryland-democrats-redraw-the-congressional-district-map/2011/08/16/gIQATbwfSJ_story.html|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=20 August 2011}}</ref>  He defeated [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent [[Helen Delich Bentley]], who had represented the 2nd district from 1985 to 1995, with 55 percent of the vote. Ruppersberger has never faced another contest even that close and has been reelected five times.
