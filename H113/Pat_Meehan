The district includes parts of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery Counties]]. He succeeded [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Joe Sestak]], who ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States Senate]].\n\nCongressman Meehan sits on the Transportation and Infrastructure, Oversight and Government Reform, and Homeland Security Committees. On the Homeland Security Committee, Meehan chairs the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies. \n\nA graduate of [[Bowdoin College]] and [[Temple University]], Meehan previously served as [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] (2001\u20132008) and as [[district attorney]] of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]] (1996\u20132001).\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn and raised in [[Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania]] by his parents Leo and Julia, Pat Meehan attended [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine and graduated in 1978 with a Bachelor\u2019s of Arts (B.A.).  While at Bowdoin, he was a standout hockey player and went on to spend two years in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as an official. Meehan attended [[Temple Law School]] in Philadelphia, and graduated with his Juris Doctorate (J.D.) in 1986.\n\n==Private law practice==\nAfter he earned a JD in 1986, he went to work as an associate at the law firm Dilworth Paxson LLP.\n\nOn July 7, 2008, Meehan announced to his staff that he would be stepping down from his position.

A year later he worked on [[Leroy S. Zimmerman|Roy Zimmerman]]'s campaign for [[Pennsylvania Attorney General]].\n\nMeehan went on to serve as Special Counsel to U.S.  Senator [[Arlen Specter]]. He was a campaign manager for U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]], Philadelphia D.A. [[Ronald D.

During Meehan's tenure as DA, his staff prosecuted several high-profile cases, including the ''Du Pont Murder Trial'', (a case involving the murder of Olympic wrestler [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|David Schultz]] by his millionaire benefactor [[John Eleuth\u00e8re du Pont]]) and the 1996 murder of a 22-year-old college student named [[Aimee Willard]] (who was abducted from [[Interstate 476|Route 476]] and found in an abandoned lot in [[North Philadelphia]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile serving as D.A., Meehan set up the ''Special Victims Unit for Domestic Violence'' in Delaware County, offered protection from the alleged abusers allowed the prosecution occur without the victims testifying in open-court.<ref>http://www.delcoda.com/information/12-das-office/division-assignments/22-special-victims-and-domestic-violence-division</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2011|http://www.delcoda.com/information/12-das-office/division-assignments/22-special-victims-and-domestic-violence-division = This cite references the unit discuss; however, there is no information on the creation of the unit.}}  As D.A. he also focused on protecting youth by expanding the ''Youth Aid Panel'' program for first time offenders and creating a truancy project to limit youth-related crime during the day.  Meehan established the [[United States Department of Justice]]\u2019s ''Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force'' (ICAC) in Pennsylvania.  The ICAC is a special unit of detectives that investigate online predators on the web and bring them to justice; it has become a model across the country.\n\n==U.S. Attorney (2001\u20132008)==\nPat Meehan became the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 17, 2001, six days after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  He was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] and confirmed by the United States Senate.  Meehan headed an office of over 200 lawyers and staffed backed up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Office.  As U.S. Attorney, Meehan has made terrorism, gang-crime, child internet-safety, and public-corruption priorities for his criminal division.  Public-corruption in Philadelphia in particular was brought to the spotlight in 2003 when a FBI electronic listening device was found in the Philadelphia Mayor\u2019s Office.\n\nIn light of the 9-11 Attacks, Meehan formed the Anti-Terrorism Task Force (ATTF), later renamed the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council (ATAC) in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to evaluate and prevent future terrorist attacks.  This initiative was done in partnership with local, state and federal law-enforcement and emergency responders.  The ATAC has led large-scale table-top and field exercises on biological attacks and the poisoning of the food-supply in partnership with Saint Joseph\u2019s University in order to help Eastern Pennsylvania to prepare for terrorist attacks.<ref name=\"usdoj.gov\">U.S. Attorney Patrick L. Meehan (Official Bio), Accessed 1/19/2008 http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pae/usa.html</ref>{{Citation broken|date=April 2011}}\n\nRecognizing the expansion of gang-related activity in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, Meehan sought a $2.5 million dollar Department of Justice grant to fight and prevent gang violence for the region.  The unique \u201cRoute 222 Corridor Anti-Gang Initiative\u201d brought together elected officials, federal, state and local law-enforcement with community groups to fight gangs in a rural area unfamiliar with big-city gang violence.  The money was divided among enforcement, prevention and rehabilitation.  The program aimed not only to increase arrests, but also to fund school programs and community centers to educate youth about the alternatives to gang life.<ref name=\"usdoj.gov\"/>{{Citation broken|date=April 2011}}\n\nContinuing the work he began while he was Delaware County D.A., Meehan continued to make child safety on the Internet a priority, sponsoring Internet safety training seminars with Web Wise Kids and visiting local schools.  Meehan\u2019s office has prosecuted sub-standard nursing homes and elder care facilities, and nefarious lenders who offered ill-advised loans to disadvantaged homeowners. (Bio) The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office under Meehan has been nationally recognized for its work in the field of health-care fraud.  The office has won more than half a billion dollars in settlements against some of the largest pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers, ensuring better self-policing and oversight by the industry.<ref>J.F.

Philadelphia is well known for its \u201cpay to play\u201d culture that rewards patronage rather than merit.  Since taking office, Meehan and his office have been actively prosecuting corrupt Philadelphia city officials.  Meehan has said, \"Pay to play cannot be standard operating procedure in city government.<ref>Mark Fazlollah and Joseph Tanfani, \"Probe reveals city's shadow government.\" Philadelphia Inquirer. 6/30/2004; Pg. A01.</ref>\u201d\n\nThis was brought to national attention on October 7, 2003 when Philadelphia Police conducted a sweep of Mayor [[John F. Street]]\u2019s office and found an electronic listening device.  It was later discovered that the \u201cbug\u201d had been planted by the FBI as part of a city corruption investigation. Street was never charged in the investigation.  Philadelphia officials and the mayor were outraged, especially with the timing coinciding with the Philadelphia Mayoral Election on November 4, 2003. Street\u2019s campaign spokesman went so far as to accuse the federal government of attempting to influence the election (which Street ended up winning anyway).<ref>Nicole Weisensee Egan, \"Meehan 'Plays It Straight'; U.S. Attorney Lauded As Man of Integrity.\" Philadelphia Daily News. 10/9/2003; Pg. 06</ref>  Meehan was applauded in the press and in the city for his handling of the situation, which resulted in twelve indictments including Street confidant Ronald White (who later died before he could stand trial) and city treasurer Corey Kemp who was convicted and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.<ref>Michael Hinkelman, \"5 guilty in City Hall corruption case appeal convictions.\"  Philadelphia Daily News. 6/6/2007. Pg. 06\"</ref>\n\nOther city officials prosecuted by Meehan\u2019s office included former city councilman Rick Mariano (who was sentenced to six and half years in federal prison for accepting bribes and attempting to influence city contracts), the President of the [[Independence Seaport Museum]] John S. Carter (who was sentenced to 15 years for cheating the museum from $1.5 million), Montgomery County accountant Denis Shusterman (for embezzling $10 million, he received a 14-year sentence),<ref>John Shiffman, \"Big jail time for museum cheat; John Carter.\" Philadelphia Inquirer. 11/3/2007.

Meehan ran unopposed for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination in the May 18, 2010 Republican primary.\n\nTo appear on the primary election ballot a candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania is required to collect valid signatures of 1,000 registered voters in the congressional district.  When evidence of fraud in some of Meehan's petitions was discovered by the Meehan campaign, Meehan alerted the Delaware County District Attorney. Michael Green, the District Attorney and Meehan supporter, turned over the matter to the office of the [[Pennsylvania Attorney General]].  Because the Attorney General, [[Tom Corbett]], is the Republican candidate for governor, Lentz requested that the [[United States Department of Justice]] take over the investigation.<ref>http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2010/04/02/news/doc4bb5576c406e2863018321.txt</ref>  Paul Summers, a Republican campaign operative and volunteer, was charged with seven counts of forgery and seven counts of making false signatures.<ref>http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/press.aspx?id=5942</ref> He was convicted on seven of the charges after pleading guilty as part of a plea-bargain deal.<ref>http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2011/04/05/news/doc4d9a8e5935767035537575.txt?viewmode=fullstory</ref>\n\nMeehan defeated Democratic State Representative [[Bryan Lentz]] 55%-44%.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2010/PA</ref><ref>[http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2010/05/19/news/doc4bf36448ea897230156378.txt delcotimes.com]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/37666-1.html?type=printer_friendly |title=Top Recruit Poised to Enter Race for Sestak Seat |publisher=Roll Call |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> \n\n;2012\n{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012#District 7}}\nMeehan won re-election to a second term with 60% of the vote over Democrat George Badey.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/PA</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nMeehan was sworn in on January 5, 2011.
