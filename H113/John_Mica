Some examples of these groups are the [[National Rifle Association]], the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]], [[American Security Council Foundation]], and the [[National Right to Life Committee]], as well as many others. On the opposing side of these positions are some Democratic-leaning interest groups, who rate John Mica as very low in areas such as abortion, sexual orientation and gay marriage rights, civil liberties and civil rights, and protecting the environment. Some of the interest groups that have given these lower ratings are Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Environment America]], [[Human Rights Campaign]], and more.  Representative Mica's views have stayed consistent in these and many other areas. One example of an area in which he has changed his ratings is the support of Arts and Humanities.  His  [[Americans for the Arts Action Fund]] ratings increased from 20% and 65% from 2000 to 2008 and then to 100% in 2011.<ref name=\"Project Vote Smart\">{{cite web|title=Representative John L.
