He is a retired [[cardiovascular surgery|cardiovascular surgeon]], who completed his residency in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]] before returning to Louisiana to take a job at [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n;2004\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2004#District 7}}\nIn 2004, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman [[Chris John]] of [[Louisiana's 7th congressional district]] decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate.  John had held the district for eight years without serious difficulty, even though it had been trending increasingly Republican at the national level. Boustany jumped into the race with another Republican, the late [[David Thibodaux]] of Lafayette, Democratic state senator [[Willie Mount]] of Lake Charles and Democratic state representative [[Don Cravins, Jr.]] of [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]]. In the open primary election, Boustany ranked first with 39 percent, with Mount garnering 25 percent for second place.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4774</ref> Under Louisiana's [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] system, in the event no candidate wins a \"50 percent plus one vote\" total, a [[runoff election|runoff]] is conducted between the two top candidates, regardless of party.\n\n[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] campaigned on behalf of Boustany. In the December 4 run-off election, Boustany defeated Mount 55-45 percent.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=139350</ref>  He became only the second Republican to represent the district, the first having been [[Jimmy Hayes]], who switched from Democratic affiliation in 1995.\n\n;2006\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2006#District 7}}\nProving just how Republican this district had become, Boustany won re-election to a second term with 71 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Mike Stagg, despite the national tide that favored Democratic congressional nominees.<ref>[http://www.theadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061108/NEWS01/611080354/1081/ Boustany secured a second term with 71 percent of vote], The Daily Advertiser</ref>\n\n;2008\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2008#District 7}}\nBoustany won re-election to a third term defeating Cravins, now a state senator, 62-34 percent.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387977</ref>\n\n;2010\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2010#District 7}}\nBoustany won re-election to a fourth term unopposed.<ref>[http://www.katc.com/news/unopposed-candidates-in-acadiana/ Unopposed Candidates in Acadiana], KATC.com</ref>\n\n;2012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2012#District 3}}\nAfter Louisiana lost a district in redistricting, most of Boustany's territory became the 3rd District.  He faced freshman fellow Republican and 3rd District incumbent [[Jeff Landry]] of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].  Although the district was numerically Landry's district, it was geographically and demographically more Boustany's district.  Indeed, the new 3rd contained almost two-thirds of Boustany's former territory, while Landry retained only the western third of his former district.\n\nEndorsed by the [[interest group]], [[Citizens United]], Landry led  Boustany in third-quarter 2011 fundraising, $251,000 to $218,000. According to [[Federal Election Commission]], Boustany led in cash-on-hand lead, $1.1 million-$402,000.<ref>http://www.politico.com/blogs/davidcatanese/1111/Citizens_United_goes_all_in_for_Landry_.html?showall</ref> In addition to Boustany and Landry, a third Republican, state Representative [[Chris Leopold]] of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]], announced through [[Facebook]] his candidacy for the seat,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/LeopoldforCongress?v=info|title=Chris Leopold for Congress|publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}</ref> but he never filed.\n\nThe Boustany-Landry race attracted most of the political attention in Louisiana in 2012, as it was seen as pitting an establishment Republican against a candidate identifying with the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]].  Though most politicians shunned involvement in the heated race, but [[Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry|Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry]] [[Michael G. Strain]] endorsed Boustany, who he described as particularly helpful to the agricultural sector while serving as a U.S. representative. Landry, meanwhile, carried the backing of most of the Republican parish executive committees in the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/news/4281456-123/boustany-gets-strains-support|title=Jordan Blum, \"Boustany gets Strain's support\"|publisher=''Baton Rouge Morning Advocate''|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}</ref> Landry also was endorsed by [[Phyllis Schlafly]]'s [[Eagle Forum]] political action committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleforum.org/election/endorse.html|title=Candidates endorsed by Eagle Forum PAC, October 31, 2012|publisher=eagleforum.org|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the November 6 election, technically a nonpartisan blanket primary for Congress, Boustany led Landry by 45,596 votes. In a five-candidate field, Boustany received 139,123 votes (44.7 percent); Landry received 93,527 votes (30 percent). Democrat Ron Richard procured the critical 67,070 votes (21.5 percent). The remaining 7,908 votes (2.5 percent) and 3,765 ballots (1.2 percent) were cast, respectively, for Republican Bryan Barrilleaux and the Libertarian Jim Stark. Because no candidate received a majority, Boustany and Landry met in a runoff contest held on December 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11062012/11062012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns, November 6, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBoustany won the runoff election against Landry with 58,820 votes (60.90 percent). He had large margins in seven of the ten parishes in the district, particularly in [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia]], [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu]], and [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette]] but lost the three parishes that Landry represents, [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin]], [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia]], and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/12082012/12082012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns, December 8, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nBoustany's plan for reinvigorating the economy of his district is known as the ''Prescription for Prosperity''.<ref>http://www.charlesboustany.com/site3.php</ref>\n\nRepresentative Boustany presented the Republican response to [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|President Barack H.
