Smith''' (born December 19, 1970) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|NE|3}}, serving since 2007. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He previously served in the [[Nebraska Legislature]].\n\n==Early life, education, and early career==\nSmith was born in [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska]] and at a young age his family moved to a rural neighborhood south of [[Gering, Nebraska]].  After graduating from [[Gering High School]] in 1989, Smith attended [[Liberty University]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. He transferred to the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] midway through his second year of college, graduating in 1993.<ref>{{cite web | title=Biographical Directory of United States Congress | work=SMITH, Adrian | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=s001172| accessdate=August 1, 2007 }}</ref> While a student at Nebraska, he interned in the Nebraska Governor\u2019s Office and, later, served as a legislative page in the [[Nebraska Unicameral]]. He returned home to Gering after college, and, in 1994, he began serving as a member of the Gering City Council.  Smith continues to live in [[Gering, Nebraska]].\n\nSmith has also worked in the private sector. He has been a realtor as well as a marketing specialist for the housing industry.\n\n==Nebraska legislature==\n===Elections===\nIn 1998, Smith defeated incumbent State Legislator [[Joyce Hillman]] 55%\u201345%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=691213 Our Campaigns - NE Legislature 48 Race - November 3, 1998<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2002, he won re-election to a second term unopposed.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=37162 Our Campaigns - NE Legislature 48 Race - November 5, 2002<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since Nebraska voters passed Initiative Measure 415 in 2001, he was term-limited.<ref>{{cite web | title=National Conference of State Legislatures | work=Term Limits in Nebraska: A Timeline\n| url=http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legman/about/nebterm.htm| accessdate=March 20, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051129070206/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legman/about/nebterm.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = November 29, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\nHe sat on the Natural Resources and Building Maintenance committees and was the vice chairperson of the Transportation and Telecommunications committee.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nebraska Unicameral Legislature | work=Sen.

Three-term incumbent [[Tom Osborne]] gave up the seat to make an unsuccessful run for [[governor of Nebraska|governor]].\n\nSmith won the Republican [[Primary election|primary]] with 39% of the vote in a field of five candidates. He faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Scott Kleeb]], a ranch hand and Yale graduate, in the [[general election]].\n\nApproximately one-third of the funding of his campaign came from members of the [[Club for Growth]], a fiscally conservative group that supports tax cuts, [[limited government]], school choice, and advocates eliminating all agricultural subsidies and the elimination of the [[US Department of Agriculture]].<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = O'Hanlon\n  | first = Kevin\n  | title = Moul gives Fortenberry run in fundraising\n  | work =\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher = Lincoln Journal Star\n  |date=October 16, 2006\n  | url = http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2006/10/16/local/doc4533ab73adf39747239555.txt\n  | accessdate = November 2, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nFor a time, Smith was presumed to be a prohibitive favorite in this overwhelmingly Republican district. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; presidential and statewide candidates routinely win it with 70 percent or more of the vote.  The 3rd is extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences.  It covers nearly {{convert|65000|sqmi|km2}}, two time zones, and 68.5 of Nebraska\u2019s 93 counties (one of which, [[Cherry County, Nebraska|Cherry County]], is larger than the entire state of [[Connecticut]]).  However, Kleeb raised more money than any other Democrat had raised in the district in decades.  Overall, the race was the most expensive in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1963.\n\nAs the race become more competitive than expected, it received late national attention from the House [[Hill committee|campaign committees]].\n<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Walton\n  | first = Don\n  | title = GOP eye on 3rd District House race\n  | publisher = Lincoln Journal Star\n  |date=October 27, 2006\n  | url = http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2006/10/27/local/doc4542996be466f643696597.txt\n  | accessdate = November 10, 2006 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Levinson\n  | first = Nathan\n  | title = Neb.
