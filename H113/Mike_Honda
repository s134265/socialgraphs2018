The district encompasses all or part of the cities of [[Cupertino]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[Milpitas]], [[Newark, California|Newark]], [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and has been serving in Congress since 2001.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Honda family.jpg|thumb|left|Young Mike Honda (bottom middle) with his family]]\n{{npov|date=August 2014}}\n\nA third generation [[Japanese American]] (\"[[sansei]]\"), Honda was born in [[Walnut Grove, California]] in 1941.<ref>http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/04/21/299055627/in-asian-majority-district-house-race-divides-calif-voters</ref> When he was one year old, he and his family were sent to [[Granada War Relocation Center|Camp Amache]], a [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese American internment camp]] in southeastern Colorado.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-mike-honda/from-camp-to-congress-my_b_1094930.html</ref> This experience shaped much of his career and political work, and compelled him to fight for those less fortunate than others, to provide opportunities for all Americans regardless of race, religious preferences, or sexual orientation, and to prevent injustices like this from ever occurring again. According to Honda, it was during these years spent within the camp that he learned being of Asian descent carried with it negative connotations in the United States, and that minority citizens, even legal, law-abiding ones, face a constant struggle for equality.<ref>http://honda.house.gov/meet-mike</ref> In 1953 his family returned to California, where they became [[strawberry]] [[sharecropper]]s in [[Blossom Valley]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].<ref>http://honda.house.gov/priorities/immigration</ref>\n\nHonda started at [[Andrew P. Hill High School]], then transferred to, and graduated from, [[San Jose High Academy|San Jos\u0117 High Academy]].<ref>http://honda.house.gov/meet-mike</ref> He entered [[San Jose State University|San Jos\u0117 State University]], but interrupted his studies from 1965 to 1967 to serve in the [[United States Peace Corps]] in [[El Salvador]], where he learned to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>http://honda.house.gov/news/in-the-news/rep-honda-on-peace-corps-service</ref> He returned to San Jose State, where in 1968 he received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Biological Sciences and Spanish. He earned a Master\u2019s degree in Education from San Jose State in 1974. In his 30-year career as an educator, Honda was a science teacher, a principal at two public schools, a school board member, and he conducted educational research at Stanford University.\n\nHonda\u2019s wife, Jeanne, was a teacher at Baldwin Elementary School in San Jos\u00e9. She died in 2004.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Jeanne-Yoshida-Honda-wife-of-congressman-2794802.php</ref> He has two children: Mark, an aerospace engineer, and Michelle, a public health educator in San Jose.

In 1981, Honda was elected to the San Jose Unified School Board. He was elected to the [[Santa Clara County]] [[Board of Supervisors]] in 1990, and to the [[California State Assembly]] in 1996, where he served until 2001.\n\nHonda won the Democratic nomination for the 15th District, which had once been represented by Norm Mineta. In 2000, Honda won by a convincing 12-point margin.\n\nIn November 2003, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee [[Terry McAuliffe]] appointed Honda as Deputy Chair of the DNC.\n\nIn February 2005, Honda was elected a Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee under the chairmanship of [[Howard Dean]]. In 2009, Congressman  Honda was reelected for a second term as DNC Vice Chair, under the chairmanship of former Virginia Governor [[Tim Kaine]]; he served in this role until 2013.\n\nDue to redistricting after the 2010 US Census, Honda began representing the [[California's 17th congressional district]] at the beginning of the [[113th Congress]] on January 3, 2013.\n\nHonda\u2019s legislative efforts have focused on many areas, including, but not limited to, education, civil rights, environment, LGBT rights, national service, foreign policy, immigration, transportation, and technology.\n\n==Committees and caucuses==\n[[Image:Honda Hydrogen Fuel Cell.jpg|thumb|Honda at the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony for the opening of a zero-emissions, [[hydrogen fuel cell]] bus program]]\nFrom 2001 to 2007 Honda served on the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]] and was the Ranking Member of its Energy Subcommittee from 2005-2007. He also served on the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]] from 2001 to 2007.

During his five years on the House Transportation Committee he secured $11 million in direct earmarks attached to a number of bills. Also during his time on that committee he facilitated the BART projects qualification for the New Starts Program, which authorized another $900 million in funds,<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3</ref> the first $400 million of which Honda managed to appropriate over the three year period of FY2012, \u201913, and \u201914.\n\nDuring the 2014 midterm election cycle Honda's opponent Ro Khanna alleged that Honda only secured $2 million for the project.<ref>http://www.ibabuzz.com/politics/2014/02/25/ca17-khanna-honda-argue-hondas-record/</ref> In response to this, a number of local officials including a Congresswoman, a State Senator, a former US Secretary of Transportation, and former and current Valley Transportation Authority chairs, sent the Khanna Campaign an open letter refuting their claims and requesting that they correct their campaign language.<ref>http://mikehonda.com/leaders-who-worked-with-rep-mike-honda-on-bart-extension-to-san-jose-call-on-ro-khanna-to-stop-misleading-attacks/</ref>\n\nThe $11 million in direct appropriations was part of:\n*H.R. 2673 (FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act, became Public Law 108-199)<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/hr2673</ref>\n*H.R. 4818 (FY 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, became Public Law 108-447)<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/hr4818</ref>\n*H.R. 3058 (the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for 2006, became Public Law 109-115)<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3058</ref>\n\nThe $400 million from the New Starts Program was allocated as follows:\n*$100M for FY 2012 in H.R. 2112, The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, which became Public Law 112-55<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr2112</ref>\n*$150M for FY 2013 in H.R. 933, the FY 2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, which became Public Law 113-6<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr933</ref>\n*$150M for FY 2014 in H.R. 3547, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which became Public Law 113-76.<ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3547</ref>\n\n==Legislation==\n\n===Raising the minimum wage===\n\nHonda has been a long-time supporter of organized labor, and has supported numerous bills for creating a living wage. In 2013 and 2014, he cosponsored the Original Living American Wage Act (H.R. 229), the WAGES Act (H.R. 650), and the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 1010), which would raise the federal minimum wage. Honda was also a supporter of the San Jose\u2019s successful ballot initiative that raised the city\u2019s minimum wage to $10 per hour.\n\n===Defense===\n\nAs former Chairman of the Afghanistan Taskforce for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and former Co-Chair of the CPC\u2019s Peace and Security Taskforce, Congressman Honda has consistently critiqued the war strategy through a series of Congressional briefings, legislation, published opinion pieces (\u201cAlternative Strategies to Obama\u2019s Afghan Agenda\u201d, \u201cA Different Kind of Surge\u201d), and Congressional letters to the Administration. Honda has advocated an orderly withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan and a significant realignment of U.S. aid to focus on strengthening government institutions, capacity building, economic development, and humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. Honda has also criticized the Obama administration for failing to seek Congressional approval for U.S. military operations in Libya.\n\nThe Congressman is also critical of the wide-scale use of drones and is a cosponsor of the Targeted Lethal Force Transparency Act (H.R. 4372) requiring an annual report on the number of civilians and combatants killed and injured in drone strikes.\n\n===Education===\n\nIn 2008, Congressman Honda worked with then-Senator Barack Obama to introduce the Enhancing STEM Education Act. Honda introduced the House version, H.R. 6104, and Obama introduced the Senate version, S.3047, on the same day.<ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/6104</ref><ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/3047</ref> The bills sought to enhance the coordination among state and federal governments to improve STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education by creating a committee on STEM education at the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and an Office of STEM at the Department of Education, instituting a voluntary State Consortium on STEM education, and creating a National STEM Education Research Repository.\nPortions of this bill (notably, creating a committee on STEM education at OSTP), as well as Honda's INVENT Act<ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1492</ref> (which would develop curriculum tools for use in teaching innovation and fostering inventiveness at the K-16 level), were eventually included in the America COMPETES Act reauthorization, which President Obama signed into law on January 4, 2011.<ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5116/text</ref>\n\nHonda led the Congressional authorization for The Equity and Excellence Commission, a commission that began in 2011 and reported its findings to the Secretary of Education in late 2012. The Commission is a federal advisory committee chartered by Congress, operating under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); 5 U.S.C., App.2.\n\nThe goal of the commission was to \u201cexamine the disparities in meaningful educational opportunities that give rise to the achievement gap, with a focus on systems of finance, and recommend ways in which federal policies could address such disparities.\u201d\n\nThe commission had 27 members from a range of backgrounds, including education, law, tax, government, business, and civil rights. The committee met 17 times in Washington, DC and across the country.\n\nIn November 2012, the commission presented its findings in a report titled \u201cFor Each and Every Child: A Strategy for Education Equity and Excellence.\u201d <ref>http://www.foreachandeverychild.org/The_Report.html</ref> The findings focused around five recommendations: (1) restructuring the financing of schools, focusing on equitable resources; (2) supporting quality teachers and school leaders; (3) supporting early childhood education; (4) promoting increased parental engagement; and, (5) addressing changes in accountability and governance in the education system.\n\n===Environment===\n\nHonda secured millions of dollars in federal funding for the cleanup and demolition of the former Almaden Air Force Station atop Mt. Umunhum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Paul|title=After 30 years, work to clean up Almaden Air Force Station finally kicks off|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/ci_15480655|website=Inside Bay Area|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> Contaminated with standard-use hazardous materials during its military use (lead paint, asbestos, etc.), the site was remediated, demolished, and is slated to open for public access in spring 2017. Honda has also advocated for programs such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n\nIn 2014, Honda introduced the Climate Change Education Act (H.R. 4461),<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4461/text</ref> legislation that aims to improving public understanding of the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment and the steps that individuals and communities can take to combat the global warming crisis.\n\n===Faith===\n\nHonda has been a defender of the civil rights of American Muslims. Soon after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Honda spoke at a convention of the American Muslim Alliance (AMA) on October 2001.<ref>http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/231-washington-report-archives-2000-2005/december-2001/3949-muslim-american-activism.html</ref> He told those in attendance not to change their identity or name. \"My last name is Honda. You cannot be more Japanese than that.\" The congressman remembered what he and especially his parents had to go through when Pearl Harbor was attacked. \"We were taken in a vehicle with windows covered, we had no idea where we were being taken.\" Because of that episode in his life, the congressman explained that he understood what the Muslims could be going through in America after the attack on September 11.\n\nIn the [[Quran Oath Controversy of the 110th United States Congress]], Rep. [[Virgil Goode]] (R-VA) issued a letter to his constituents stating his view that the decision of Representative-elect [[Keith Ellison]] (D-MN) to use the Quran in his swearing-in ceremony is a threat to \"the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America... I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies\u201d. In response, Honda penned a response to Goode expressing his surprise and offense by that letter and declaring \u201cNo person should be labeled as un-American based on his or her religion, and it is outrageous to cast aspersions on Representative-elect Ellison purely because of his religious background.\u201d<ref>http://www.archives2006.ghazali.net/html/muslims_question_gop.html#Honda</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Honda introduced the Freedom of Faith Act (H.R. 4460).<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4460, To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to repeal the sunset of the special immigrant non minister religious worker program, via GovTrack.us|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4460|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> The Act would make permanent the special immigrant provision for non-minister religious workers, which is set to expire in 2015. Honda also urged President Obama to convene the first ever White House Summit on Religious Diversity.\n\n===Government reform===\nIn 2007, Honda voted for the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which was the legislative response to the Jack Abramoff scandal and introduced comprehensive new transparency requirements for lobbyists and for Members of Congress. In 2012, he cosponsored H.R. 1148, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which criminalized insider trading by Members of Congress and required numerous disclosures.<ref>http://insidertrading.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004520</ref> He voted for H.Res. 895, which created the first-ever independent ethics office, the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\n===Health care===\nHonda has advocated for the expansion of health coverage for all through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and is a big proponent of the public option. As the Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Honda was successful in ensuring that the ACA addressed racial and ethnic health disparities, including improvements in data collection, and measures to increase the number of health care providers from different backgrounds.\n\nAs the Chairman and Chair Emeritus of Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, he sponsored and supported the Health Care Equality and Accountability Act, which would have expanded access to care for individuals with limited English proficiency, increased health workforce diversity, and encouraged further studies on the minority health issues. As a member of the TriCaucus with the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Honda has introduced legislation focused on health disparities in correlation to an annual health disparities summit.\n\nHonda has led efforts to address tuberculosis by seeking changes to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) formula for direct funding for tuberculosis treatment and education to include highly impacted counties.

Honda fought against the [[Stupak\u2013Pitts Amendment]], which would have prohibited the use of federal funds \"to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion\" except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. Through his role in the House Appropriations Committee, he has consistently supported funding Title X\u2014the only federal grant program that is completely devoted to providing comprehensive family planning and other preventive health services. He has also secured funding for projects that promote women\u2019s and children\u2019s health and wellbeing, such as mobile mammography units, youth mentoring grants, and child obesity programs.\n\nHonda has supported Medicare and Medicaid programs throughout his career, fighting for the health rights of seniors and low-income families. He introduced the People\u2019s Budget, the Congressional Progressive Caucus 2012 budget alternative, which would keep Medicare and Medicaid solvent while closing the national debt within 10 years.<ref>http://grijalva.house.gov/uploads/The%20CPC%20FY2012%20Budget.pdf</ref> Honda supports the permanent repeal of the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) and cosponsored the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015) which would have repealed the SGR and improved the physician payment system to reward value over volume.\n\n===Human rights===\n\nOn the issue of comfort women, in 2007 Honda proposed US H.Res. 121, which stated that Japan should formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner, refute any claims that the issue of comfort women never occurred, and educate current and future generations \"about this horrible crime while following the recommendations of the international community with respect to the 'comfort women'.\"<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hres121</ref> Honda has stated, \"the purpose of this resolution is not to bash or humiliate Japan.\"\n\nOn July 30, 2007, the House of Representatives passed Honda's resolution after 30 minutes of debate, in which no opposition was voiced. Honda was quoted on the floor as saying, \"We must teach future generations that we cannot allow this to continue to happen. I have always believed that reconciliation is the first step in the healing process.\"\n\nHonda later secured report language in the Fiscal Year 2014 Consolidated Appropriation Act (submitted July 2013) urging the Secretary of State to encourage the Government of Japan to address issues raised in H.Res.121. President Obama signed the spending bill into law on January 17, 2014.\n\nHonda works on the elimination of human trafficking. He cosponsored  the Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination Act of 2013 (H.R. 3344).<ref>http://dyn.realclearpolitics.com/congressional_bill_tracker/bill/113/hr3344</ref> The bill address predatory recruiters who use international labor recruitment as a human trafficking medium.

Honda has been a proponent of government intelligence transparency and has pushed to require that top-line intelligence spending be disclosed during annual budget submission to Congress through his cosponsorship of the Intelligence Budget Transparency Act (H.R. 3855).\n\nIn 2002, he introduced one of the first nanotechnology bills in Congress, the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act of 2002,<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.5669, Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act of 2002 |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.r.5669:|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> which sought to establish a Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board to advise the President on a range of policy matters. Such a board was recommended by the National Research Council in its review of the National nanotechnology Initiative, Small Wonders, Endless Frontiers.\n\nIn 2003, he worked with then-Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY), to introduce the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003.<ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/766/cosponsors</ref> This bill authorized federal investments in nanotechnology research and development, restructured the National Nanotechnology Initiative to improve interagency coordination and the level of input from outside experts in the field, and laid the path to address novel social, ethical, philosophical, legal, environmental health issues that might arise. H.R. 766 was passed overwhelmingly by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 7, 2003, signed into law on December 3, 2003, and to date has been funded at nearly $4 billion.\n\nHonda continued his interest in nanotechnology by convening the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology with then-controller Steve Westly in 2005.<ref>http://wesrac.usc.edu/TTC/projects/blueribbon.asp</ref> This group met numerous times to discuss and develop strategies to promote the San Francisco Bay Area and all of California as the national and worldwide center for nanotechnology research, development and commercialization. Under the direction of Working Chair Scott Hubbard, then-Director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center, the Task Force spent a year developing recommendations that would assure California a leading position in what could be a trillion-dollar economic sector. The recommendations were included in the BRTFN report, Thinking Big About Thinking Small.\n\nHonda developed two pieces of legislation based on the report: 1) the Nanomanufacturing Investment Act of 2005<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr1491</ref> and 2) the Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities Act.<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr2749</ref> Many provisions of these bills were included in larger pieces of legislation, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr554</ref> and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, that passed the House of Representatives in the 111th Congress.<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr5116</ref>\n\nCongressman Honda's accomplishments in the field of nanotechnology policy has been recognized by the Foresight Institute, which awarded him its Foresight Institute Government Prize in 2006.<ref>http://www.foresight.org/FI/fi_spons.html</ref>\n\n===Research and Development tax credit===\n\nCongressman Honda has supported expanding and making permanent the Research and Development tax credit, and in the 113th Congress is a cosponsor of the bipartisan H.R. 4438, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014.<ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4438/cosponsors</ref> He has called the research credit, \u201cthe best incentive in the tax code to ensure that companies continue to conduct their R&D in the U.S.\u201d\n\n===Seniors and retirement security===\n\nHonda has been a vocal advocate for expanding the Social Security program. In the 113th Congress, Honda introduced H.R. 3118, the Strengthening Social Security Act, with Congresswoman Linda Sanchez (D-CA) and Congressman Rush Holt (D-NJ), which would increase benefits for current beneficiaries, eliminate the cap on how much of an individual\u2019s earnings can be paid into Social Security, change the benefits formula to increase payments by about $70 a month, and adopt a higher cost of living adjustment called CPI-E, designed to reflect the cost of healthcare for seniors.\n\nAlso in the 113th Congress, Honda authored H.R. 4202, the CPI-E Act of 2014, which would apply CPI-E to index federal retirement programs other than Social Security, to include programs such as civil service retirement, military retirement, Supplemental Security Income, veterans pensions and compensations, and other retirement programs with COLAs triggered directly by Social Security or civil service retirement. As a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Budget Taskforce, Honda also inserted this CPI-E provision into the FY 2015 CPC Budget, entitled the \u201cBetter Off Budget.\u201d Honda said during floor debate on the CPC budget, that the provision was intended to be a first step to applying CPI-E to all federal retirement programs, including Social Security.\n\n===Veterans===\n\nHonda has been a leading voice to overhaul and improve the current VA system. As an appropriator, he worked with his colleagues in both parties to not only call for change, but to provide funds to create a new electronic health record program between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. He is also working to ensure that the government makes use of the knowledge and experience of health information technology experts, such as those in Silicon Valley, to ensure this new platform will eliminate the current backlog of claims.\n\nHonda helped obtain $2.8 million in grants to aid homeless and at-risk veterans and their families in Silicon Valley.\n\n===Women\u2019s rights===\n\nHonda has a 100% legislative score from Planned Parenthood<ref>http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections-politics/congressional-scorecard/#/california/176</ref> and from the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) and has been a long-time supporter of pro-choice legislation and for women\u2019s health. Honda has supported Paycheck Fairness Act and voted for the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act\u2014the first piece of legislation to signed by President Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nDuring the debate over the new health care bill, Honda voted against the Stupak Amendment, which would have limited a woman\u2019s ability to purchase coverage for reproductive health services with her own money.\n\nIn 2013, he voted for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which included updated protections for Native American women, immigrant women, and provided specialized support and resources for LGBT, religious and ethnic communities. VAWA reauthorization also included the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which Honda has also supported. Honda introduced the Domestic Violence Judicial Support Act of 2013, which would strengthen the judicial programs that comprise the basis of VAWA.\n\nTo support full implementation of the Obama Administration\u2019s Executive Order 13595 and the U.S. National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security, and to secure Congressional oversight, Honda introduced the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2013, along his female colleagues, Congresswomen Jan Schakowsky, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Niki Tsongas.\n\n==Electoral history in the U.S. House of Representatives==\n{{Election box begin no change|title=[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2000]]<ref>[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2000_general/us_rep.pdf Office of the California Secretary of State] \"United States Representative in Congress, (retrieved 29 July 2009)</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change| |party=Democratic Party (United States)|candidate=Mike Honda|votes=128,545|percentage=54.3}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change| |party=Republican Party (United States)|candidate=Jim Cunneen|votes=99,866|percentage=42.2}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change| |party=Libertarian Party (United States)|candidate=Ed Wimmers|votes=4,820|percentage=2.0}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change| |party=Natural Law Party (United States)|candidate=Douglas C.
