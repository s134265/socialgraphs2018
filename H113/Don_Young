The bridge would be used for access by emergency vehicles, as well as passengers. Currently there is a small car and passenger ferry that travels the 1/4 mile (400 m) crossing in 3 to 7 minutes and runs every half hour. Critics assailed this as [[pork barrel]] spending at taxpayers' expense and dubbed it the \"Bridge to Nowhere.\" The Gravinia Island Bridge was awarded a Golden Fleece by the federal budget watchdog organization [[Taxpayers for Common Sense]] in 2003.<ref>{{citation |title=Golden Fleece: $190 Million Bridge to Nowhere |url=http://www.taxpayer.net/user_uploads/file/Awards/GoldenFleece/gravina.pdf |date=2003-06-09 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref> After criticism from citizens and others in Congress, lawmakers de-funded the bridge and instead funneled the money to Alaska's Department of Transportation, allowing the [[Governor of Alaska]] to start road construction after the Alaska Legislature funded the project with the directed monies.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Clarren |title=A bridge to nowhere |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/08/09/bridges/index_np.html |work=Salon |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>\n\n====[[Knik Arm Bridge]]====\n\nAnother bridge earmarked in the bill connects Anchorage to [[Point MacKenzie, Alaska|Pt.

The top two executives of that company had already pleaded guilty to bribing members of the Alaska legislature.<ref name=\"AP-7-24-07\">[http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/story/9162143p-9077780c.html \"Paper reports Young's Veco ties investigated\"], ''Associated Press'', July 25, 2007</ref> The Journal said a VECO executive held fundraisers called \"the Pig Roast\" for Young every August for ten years. Between 1996 and 2006, Young received $157,000 from VECO employees and its political action committee. In the first half of 2007, Young spent more than $250,000 of his campaign contributions for legal fees.<ref name=\"young\"/>\n\nA confession signed by Bill Allen, the former chief of VECO, was released in October 2009. Allen agreed that from 1993 to August 2006, both he and his deputy at VECO, Rick Smith, \"provided things of value to United States Representative A,\" a reference to Young. For example, in June 2006, Smith obtained a set of golf clubs, costing approximately $1,000, that Smith gave to Young. Although Young was obligated in 2006 to report gifts with a value of more than $335, he didn't report receiving any gifts on the personal financial disclosure form he filed with the House of Representatives for that year.<ref>Bribery, [http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/AP/story/1295902.html \"Bribery allegations surface against Alaska Rep.
