Cleaver currently represents {{ushr|MO|5}}, where he's served since 2005. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and in January 2010, Cleaver became chair of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].\n\nCleaver previously served on the Kansas City Council from 1979 to 1991, until he was elected [[List of mayors of Kansas City, Missouri|Mayor of Kansas City]], serving from 1991 to 1999. In 2004, Cleaver was elected to {{ushr|MO|5}}, where his district includes the southern three-fourths of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], including  all of the city south of the [[Missouri River]]. It also includes most of the city's suburbs in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]].\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nCleaver was born in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], the son of Marie (n\u00e9e McKnight) and Lucky G.

He is the first [[African American]] mayor of Kansas City. During the last days of his tenure as Mayor, Reverend Cleaver agreed to an international visit to [[London, England]]. On the invitation of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[NGO]] Operation Black Vote he assisted in campaigning for increased electoral participation in the elections for the [[Mayor of London]] and the [[London Assembly]]. His visit culminated in a keynote speech at [[Westminster City Hall]] alongside British political figures including [[Ken Livingstone]], [[Simon Hughes]] and [[Lee Jasper]].  Cleaver is a cousin to exiled KC Black Panther leader [[Pete O'Neal]].  In 1997, Cleaver attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a pardon for O'Neal from President Clinton.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/world/a-black-panther-s-mellow-exile-farming-in-africa.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm</ref>\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\nAfter the compromise [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control Act]] deal had been reached to resolve the [[2011 United States debt ceiling crisis]] in August 2011, Cleaver wrote on [[Twitter]] calling it a \"sugar-coated Satan sandwich\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Seung Min|title=Debt-ceiling deal frustrates House liberals|publisher=Politico|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60423.html|accessdate=2 August 2011|date=1 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]]'''\n**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity|Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity]]\n**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology|Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology]]\n\n===Caucus membership===\n*[[Congressional Black Caucus]] (Chair)\n\n===Tenure===\nDuring his tenure, Cleaver has voted with the Democratic party 95.8% of the time.<ref name=\"Voting Statistics\">{{cite web|title=Voting Statistics for Emanuel Cleaver|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/House/Missouri/Emanuel_Cleaver/VotingStatistics/|publisher=The Political Guide|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> He has been recognized as a Congressman who is \"not shy about earmarks\", and has brought many tax dollars back to Kansas City.<ref name=\"Cleaver JCDC Biography\">{{cite news|title=Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, II|url=http://jacksoncountydemocraticcommittee.org/elected-officials/emanuel-cleaver/|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=Jackson County Democratic Committee}}</ref>\n\nCleaver has called for ethics charges against Representatives [[Charlie Rangel]] and [[Maxine Waters]] to be dropped, saying \"The process has been tainted.\"<ref name=\"Cleaver ethics charges dropped\">{{cite news|last=Kraske|first=Steve|title=Cleaver wants ethics charges against Waters, Rangel dropped|url=http://midwestdemocracy.com/articles/kraske-cleaver-wants-charges-against-waters-rangel-dropped/|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Loan default===\nOn April 6, 2012, the ''Kansas City Star'' reported that [[Bank of America]] had sued Cleaver Company LLC over a commercial real estate loan for a Grandview car wash.

Despite having served in city government for 20 years, including eight years as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections. Cleaver went on to defeat former [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration official [[Jamie Metzl]] in the Democratic primary by a margin of 60-40 percent. In the general election, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Jeanne Patterson used her own fortune to fund her candidacy and made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as the second-most Democratic district in Missouri. The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949.  By comparison, McCarthy won 65 percent in 2002.\n\nCleaver has been reelected twice with some opposition.  In 2010, Jacob Turk (Republican) received 45 percent of the vote, with Cleaver receiving 53 percent.  In 2012, Cleaver received 60 percent of the vote, with Turk receiving 37 percent. <ref>{{cite web|title=5th District (MO) Election Results|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Missouri%27s_5th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website=BallotPedia.org|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2008 Presidential election===\nDuring the course of the Democratic Presidential Primary, Cleaver endorsed [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=2953 Missouri Rep.
