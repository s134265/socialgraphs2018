He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The district includes most of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], an affluent suburban county adjacent to [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as portions of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]] and [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]] counties. He is an alumnus of the [[Kodaikanal International School]], a very prestigious school in southern India.\n\nSpeaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. After the Democrats regained control of the House in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 elections]], Van Hollen became the chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], the fifth-ranking position among House Democrats. In this post, Van Hollen was responsible for leading efforts to get more Democrats elected to Congress.\n\nAfter the Democratic losses in 2010, Van Hollen did not run for re-election to chair of the DCCC. Van Hollen instead chose to run for the top Democratic spot on the [[House Budget Committee]], which was being vacated by outgoing chairman [[John Spratt]] who had been defeated for re-election. Van Hollen was elected as the ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010.  Pelosi appointed him to the 12-member bipartisan [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Committee on Deficit Reduction]] with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013 Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pelosi Names Conferees to FY 2014 Budget Conference|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704022207/http://www.democraticleader.gov/Pelosi_Statement_on_Conferess_to_FY_2014_Budget_Conference|website=www.democraticleader.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nVan Hollen was born in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], the youngest of three children of American parents Edith Eliza (n\u00e9e Farnsworth) and [[Christopher Van Hollen (diplomat)|Christopher Van Hollen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/vanhollen.htm |title=Christopher Van Hollen, Jr |publisher=Ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/25/AR2007022501387.html |title=State Department Policy Analyst Eliza Van Hollen |publisher=The Washington Post |date=February 26, 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> His father was a [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] officer who served as Deputy [[Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs]] (1969\u201372) and [[United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives|U.S. Ambassador]] to [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Maldives]] (1972\u201376);<ref name=bsun>{{cite news |first=Jacques|last=Kelly|title=Christopher Van Hollen Sr., ambassador, Former Baltimorean and father of Md. congressman was ambassador to Sri Lanka and career Foreign Service officer |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-02-03/news/bs-md-ob-christopher-vanhollen-20130201_1_political-debates-ambassador-baltimore-gas |work= [[Baltimore Sun]]  |publisher= |date=2013-02-03 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref> and his mother worked in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], where she served as chief of the intelligence bureau for [[South Asia]].<ref name=wp2>{{cite news |first=|last=|title=State Department Policy Analyst Eliza Van Hollen |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/25/AR2007022501387.html |work= [[Washington Post]]  |publisher= |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref><ref name=matusow>{{cite news|date=2008-06-01|work=[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]|title=Can Nice Guy Chris Van Hollen Finish First?|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/7994.html|last=Matusow|first=Barbara}}</ref><ref name=mother>{{cite news|date=2007-02-26|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=State Department Policy Analyst Eliza Van Hollen|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/25/AR2007022501387.html}}</ref> He also lived in [[Turkey]], [[India]], and Sri Lanka.<ref name=matusow/> He returned to the [[United States]] for his junior year of high school, and attended [[Middlesex School]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Massachusetts]], where his grandfather once taught.<ref name=matusow/>\n\nIn 1982, Van Hollen graduated from [[Swarthmore College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in philosophy.<ref name=directory>{{cite news|work=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]|title=VAN HOLLEN, Christopher, (1959 - )|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=v000128}}</ref> He continued his studies at [[Harvard University]], where he earned a [[Master of Public Policy]] degree, concentrating in national security studies, from the [[John F.

In 2010 he became a co-chair of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and has sponsored numerous bills that would benefit individuals with disabilities.\n\n==Political campaigns==\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#8th Congressional District}}\nPrior to Van Hollen's election, incumbent [[Connie Morella]] had won eight elections in the district, despite the fact that she was a Republican in a district where Democrats far outnumbered Republicans. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively [[Liberalism|liberal]] voting record, including support for [[abortion rights]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]] and increased [[environmentalism|environmental protections]].\n\nAfter Morella's re-election in 2000, Democratic [[Maryland Senate]] President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.|Thomas V. \"Mike\" Miller]] made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one [[redistricting]] plan after the 2000 Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate [[Mark Kennedy Shriver]] in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic by adding heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring [[Prince George's County]], an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.\n\nIn 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former [[Clinton administration]] aide [[Ira Shapiro]]. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.\n\nDuring the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept [[Tom DeLay]] and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, [[HMO]] reform, [[trigger lock]]s for handguns, and protecting the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[oil drilling]]. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.<ref name=\"apsanet.org\"/>  Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County.  However, Morella won the precincts she'd previously represented.\n\nProving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote.  However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.\n\nAfter the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic.  He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]], and lost his share of Prince George's County to the [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th district]].  In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily  and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County.  Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over  with 63 percent of the vote.  While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.\n\n== Positions ==\nVan Hollen has been endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]],<ref name=vote-smart.org3>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/interest-group/122/brady-campaign-to-prevent-gun-violence|title=Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence - Project Vote Smart|accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> a group which campaigns for more government regulation of guns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradycampaign.org|title=Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence|accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> Van Hollen received a 0% from the Gun Owners of America (GOA) in 2006.<ref name=Vote-smart.org>{{cite web|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/candidate/6098/chris-van-hollen-jr|title=Christopher Van Hollen, Jr. Summary - Project Vote Smart|work=Chris Van Hollen|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref> In September 2008, Van Hollen voted against repealing portions of the D.C.

However, he was prevented from doing so by a recent change in rules:\n\" (R-Utah), presiding over the chamber, told Van Hollen that the rule he was asking to use had been \u201caltered\u201d and he did not have the privilege of bringing that vote to the floor. In the ensuing back and forth, Chaffetz said the recently passed House Resolution 368 trumped the standing rules.
