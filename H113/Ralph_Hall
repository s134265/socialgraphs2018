He was an early supporter of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and also favored legislation requiring a super-majority on any tax increases. He frequently clashed with the [[Clinton Administration]], and voted for three of the four articles of impeachment against President [[Bill Clinton]]. He endorsed [[George W. Bush]] for President in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], becoming one of the few Democratic politicians to do so. The two had been friends for many years.\n\nWhile he was very conservative, even by Texas Democratic standards, his [[conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] can be attributed to the demographics of the 4th District. It had once been reliably Democratic, but became increasingly friendly to Republicans as Dallas' suburban growth spilled into the western portion of the district. The 4th has not supported the Democratic nominee for president since [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]]. Despite this district's increasingly Republican tilt, Hall won 10 more terms as a member of the Democratic Party with an average of 60% of the vote. In 1994, for instance, he was re-elected by a 19-point margin, even as other conservative Democratic congressmen lost their seats. By the 1990s, he was the only elected Democratic official above the county level in much of the district. It was taken for granted that he would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.\n\nLike many in the Democratic Party, he voted against the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. In 1999, he was one of six Democratic congressmen who supported a Republican tax cut plan. He has been an original co-sponsor of bills to repeal the estate tax and the marriage tax penalty.\n\nIn late 2002, he voted for the resolution allowing the use of force in Iraq. In March 2003, he voted for a budget that included Bush's 10-year, $726 billion tax cut plan. The plan passed the House 215-212.\n\n;2004 Party Switch\nHall was frequently rumored as a candidate to [[party switching in the United States|switch parties]], especially after the Republicans took control of the House in 1995. Even as Democratic Party members with far less conservative voting records, such as [[Greg Laughlin]], [[Jimmy Hayes]], [[Billy Tauzin]] and [[Nathan Deal]] all switched parties, he insisted that he would remain with the Democratic Party as long as it did not hurt his constituents. He said that he had an obligation to \"pull my party back toward the middle.\" He was one of the co-founders of the [[Blue Dog Democrats|Blue Dog Coalition]], a group of moderate and conservative Democratic congressmen.\n\nIn 2003, [[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]] engineered a controversial [[2003 Texas redistricting|mid-decade redistricting]]. He was the only white Democratic congressman not targeted by the remap. However, his district was shifted slightly to the north. Tyler, the heart of the 4th for a century, was shifted to the neighboring 1st District. It did, however, pick up most of [[Collin County, Texas|Collin County]], which had been part of the district until the 1980s round of redistricting.\n\nIn January 2004, on the final day for candidates to file to get their names on the ballot for the March 9, 2004 primary, Hall switched parties and became a Republican. He said that Republicans refused to put money for his district into a spending bill, and when he asked why, \"the only reason I was given was that I was a Democrat.\" He also cited concerns with his Democratic criticism of President Bush; he hadn't attended Democratic caucus meetings for some time due to the criticism leveled at Bush, his longtime friend. He told the press, \"The country is at war. When the country is at war you need to support the president. Some of my fellow congressmen have not been doing that.\"<ref name=\"CNN-2004\">John Mercurio, [http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/02/elec04.h.party.switch/index.html \"Texas Rep. Hall switches to GOP\"], CNN.com, January 3, 2004</ref>\n\nAfter the switch, the Republican Party allowed him to keep his seniority. He became chairman of the House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality. He also joined the [[Republican Study Committee]], a caucus of conservative House Republicans.\n\n;Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)\n{{see also|Jack Abramoff CNMI scandal}}\n\nThe [[Northern Mariana Islands]] are a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific with a large garment industry. Billing records of [[Preston Gates|Preston Gates Ellis and Rouvelas Meeds]], an international law firm employed by the CNMI, the government of the islands, show numerous contacts between the law firm and Hall's office. He said his dealings with the law firm were with Lloyd Meeds, a partner with the firm, which at the time listed 36 attorneys on staff, not with [[Jack Abramoff]], the firm's representative for the CNMI contract. In 2006, he said of the Northern Marianas, \"They were good allies, and I believed their government should handle their affairs and not have us impose labor laws on them.\"<ref name=\"TPN-10-01-06\">Mary Madewell, [http://theparisnews.com/mobile/mobilestory.lasso?ewcd=fa13afebfa7e1d78 \"Democrat: Hall had ties to jailed lobbyist\"], ''The Paris News'' (Texas), October 1, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/abramoff-cnmi-billings/?resultpage=1& Letter from Preston Gates Ellis to CNMI, May 6, 1997]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1996, Hall and E.K.
