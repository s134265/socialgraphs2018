He was defeated for re-election in 2014, one of only two incumbent House Republicans to lose their seat in the general election that year, the other being [[Steve Southerland (Florida politician)|Steve Southerland]] of Florida.\n\n==Early life==\nTerry was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the son of Mary Chalone (n\u00e9e Courtney) and Leland Roy Terry.<ref>http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/omaha/obituary.aspx?n=mary-chalone-courtney-terry-markham&pid=170243109</ref> He graduated from [[Omaha Northwest High School]]. He then attended the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. He received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Creighton University School of Law]] in 1987. He worked as a private practice attorney specializing in civil matters before entering politics. He was a member of the [[Omaha City Council]] from 1991 to 1998, and served for two years as president and another two years as vice president of the body. While on the city council, Terry advocated using private-public partnerships as a way to lower taxation within Omaha.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n===Elections===\n;1998\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections, 1998#Nebraska}}\nIn 1998, incumbent Republican Representative [[Jon Lynn Christensen]] retired to run for [[governor of Nebraska]]. Terry ran to succeed him, winning the Republican primary with a plurality, 40%, in a three-way race. Attorney Steve Kupka came second with 30%, businessman Brad Kuiper came third with 27% and three other candidates took the remaining 4%.
