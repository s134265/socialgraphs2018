The district consists of Southeast and South Central Missouri and includes the [[Missouri Bootheel|Bootheel]], the [[Lead Belt]] and the [[Ozarks]]. Emerson is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. On January 22, 2013, Emerson resigned her seat in Congress to become the President and Chief Executive Officer of the [[National Rural Electric Cooperative Association]].\n\nWith the defeat of Congressman [[Ike Skelton]], Emerson became the dean, ''i.e.'', the longest-serving member, of [[United States congressional delegations from Missouri|Missouri's congressional delegation]] in 2011.\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nShe was born Jo Ann Hermann in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. She was a daughter of Albert \"A.B.\" Hermann, who played for the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Braves]] baseball team from 1923\u20131924 and was executive director of the Republican National Committee.<ref name=\"SSD100912\">{{cite news\n  |first=\n  |last=\n  |url=http://www.standard-democrat.com/story/1350362.html\n  |title=Emerson's Mother Dies\n  |work=[[Sikeston Standard Democrat]]\n  |date=September 9, 2003\n  |accessdate=2012-10-09\n}}</ref> She graduated from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=e000172|title=EMERSON, Jo Ann, (1950 - )|publisher= Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate= October 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/emerson.htm</ref> She married future [[U.S. Representative]] [[Bill Emerson]], a Republican from Cape Girardeau, on June 22, 1975. They had two daughters; Jo Ann also has five stepdaughters and a stepson. Bill was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1980 from Missouri's 10th Congressional District and, subsequent to redistricting, was reelected in 1982 from the 8th District. He died from [[cancer]] on June 22, 1996, a few months before the end of his eighth term. The [[Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge]], which links [[Missouri]] to [[Illinois]] across the [[Mississippi River]], was dedicated to commemorate his efforts to obtain [[Earmark (finance)|federal funding]] for its construction.\n\nFollowing Bill's death, Jo Ann married Ron Gladney in 2000. From this marriage she gained a stepdaughter and a stepson.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations]]'''\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies]]\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government|Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government]] (Chairwoman)\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch|Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch]] (Vice Chair)\n\n===Other memberships===\n*Vice President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly\n**Vice Chair of the Subcommittee on Democratic Governance\n*Vice Chair of the Center Aisle Caucus\n*Honorary and Life Trustee of Westminster College\n*Co-Chair of the Board of Directors for the Congressional Hunger Center\n*Founding Member of the Bipartisan Congressional Retreat\n\nEmerson, whose voting record in Congress has established her as one of the more moderate Republicans, has a history of bipartisanship while in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a member of the moderate Republican groups the [[Republican Main Street Partnership]] and [[The Tuesday Group (of moderate Republican congressmen)|The Tuesday Group]].\n\nOn May 24, 2005, Emerson was one of 50 Republicans to vote in favor of overturning President [[George W. Bush]]'s ban on federal funding for [[Embryonic stem cells|embryonic stem cell]] research. She cast her \"yea\" vote the day after her mother-in-law died from [[Alzheimer's Disease]], one of the illnesses for which scientists believe they can create better treatments from stem cell research.\n\nOn July 12, 2007, Emerson was one of only four Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll624.xml</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 2009, Emerson was one of seven House Republicans to vote in favor of the Democrats' proposed resolution to condemn [[U.S. Representative]] [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-[[South Carolina]]) for shouting \"You lie!\" in the middle of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s joint address to the U.S. Congress on health care reform.\n\nHer margins of victory in the district have always been higher than those of GOP presidential candidates [[George W. Bush]] and [[John McCain]] as well as Republican gubernatorial candidates [[Kenny Hulshof]], [[Matt Blunt]] and [[Jim Talent]].\n\nEmerson announced in early December 2012 her plans to retire from Congress in February 2013 to assume a position with the [[National Rural Electric Cooperative Association]] as its president and [[Chief Executive Officer]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Jo Ann Emerson to retire in Feb.|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/jo-ann-emerson-retiring-84508.html?hp=bn|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nWhen her husband Bill died in 1996, Jo Ann announced she would run for his vacant seat.  However, Missouri state law prohibited her from filing in the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] [[primary election|primary]] for the general election. In November, Jo Ann Emerson competed in two elections on the same day. She ran as a Republican against Democrat Emily Firebaugh in the special election to finish the last two months of her late husband's final term, and as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] against Democrat Firebaugh and Republican Richard Kline in the general election for a full two-year term. She won both elections easily and has been reelected seven times without serious difficulty. She is the first Republican woman elected to the U.S. Congress from Missouri. She served the last two months of her husband's term as an independent caucusing with the Republicans before officially becoming a Republican at the start of the new Congress in 1997. She was briefly the first independent elected to federal office in Missouri in 122 years.<ref>{{Cite book\n | author =\n | year =\n | title = Official Manual State of Missouri 2001\u20132002\n | publisher =[[Missouri Secretary of State]]\n | location =\n | id =\n | page = 117\n}}</ref>\n\n===2008===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2008#District 8}}\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2010#District 8}}\n\n===2012===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2012#District 8}}\n\n===2013===\n{{See also|Missouri's 8th congressional district special election, 2013}}\n\n==Electoral history==\n{{Election box begin | title=2010 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri\u2019s 8th Congressional District }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Republican Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Jo Ann Emerson\n  |votes      = 128,499\n  |percentage = 65.56\n  |change     = -5.88\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Tommy Sowers \n  |votes      = 56,377\n  |percentage = 28.76\n  |change     = +2.60\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Independent (politician) \n  |candidate  = Larry Bill \n  |votes      = 7,193\n  |percentage = 3.67\n  |change     = +3.67\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Rick Vandeven\n  |votes      = 3,930\n  |percentage = 2.01\n  |change     = +0.41\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Election box begin | title=2008 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri\u2019s 8th Congressional District }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Republican Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Jo Ann Emerson\n  |votes      = 198,798\n  |percentage = 71.44\n  |change     = -0.20\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Joe Allen\n  |votes      = 72,790\n  |percentage = 26.16\n  |change     = -0.24\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Branden C.
