The district had long been a Republican stronghold, but it had been significantly reconfigured.  The [[Maryland General Assembly]] shifted heavily Republican [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]] and a mostly Republican section of [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] to the heavily Democratic [[Maryland's 8th congressional district|8th district]].  It also shifted Republican-tilting sections of [[Harford County|Harford]] and [[Baltimore County|Baltimore]] counties to the already heavily Republican [[Maryland's 1st congressional district|1st district]].  Taking their place was a heavily Democratic section of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], which ended just two blocks from Delaney's home in [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]]. On paper, this dramatically altered the district's demographics, turning it from a heavily Republican district into a Democratic-leaning district.  While [[John McCain]] carried the 6th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] would have carried the new 6th with 56 percent.\n\nDuring the primary, Delaney was endorsed by President [[Bill Clinton]], U.S. Congresswoman [[Donna Edwards]], Comptroller [[Peter Franchot]], the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and the ''Gazette''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Pershing |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/delaney-md-democrats-work-to-show-unified-front-after-newcomers-primary-win/2012/04/04/gIQA6u0GvS_story.html |title=Delaney, Md.
