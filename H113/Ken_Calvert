He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is part of the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] and south Orange County areas of [[Southern California]].\n\n==Early life, education, and business career==\nCalvert was born in [[Corona, California]] to Marceline Hamblen and Ira D. Calvert, Jr.,<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/calvert.htm calvert<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and still lives in Corona. In 1970, shortly after high school, he joined the campaigns of former state legislator [[Victor Veysey]]. Calvert worked in Veysey's Washington, D.C., office as an intern after a 1972 victory. He graduated from [[Corona High School]] in 1971.\n\nCalvert received an [[associate of arts]] degree from [[Chaffey College|Chaffey Community College]] in 1973 and a bachelors of arts degree [[San Diego State University]] in 1975. After graduation, he managed his family's restaurant, the Jolly Fox, in Corona for five years. He then entered the real estate industry and ran Ken Calvert Real Properties until he was elected to Congress.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1982, the 29 year old Calvert ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] to represent a newly drawn district.  He narrowly lost the Republican primary to Riverside County Supervisor [[Al McCandless]], who had been the choice of the Republican establishment.  McCandless went on to win the general election.\n\nCalvert was first elected to the House in 1992, when McCandless was re-elected in a different district.  Calvert won the general election with 47% of the vote (a plurality, but he was the highest vote-getter), defeating Democrat [[Mark Takano]] by 519 votes. In 1994, he was challenged in the Republican primary by Joe Khoury and won renomination by only 51% to 49%.  He was re-elected in the 1994 general election with 55 percent, again defeating Takano. Ironically, he now serves in the House alongside his former opponent; Takano was elected to Congress in an adjacent district in 2012.\n\nIn 1996, he was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Guy Kimbrough. In 1998 he defeated Democrat Mike Rayburn with 55 percent of the vote. Calvert won again in 2000 with 74 percent of the vote, facing no major-party opposition.\n\nCalvert was re-elected in 2002, defeating Louis Vandenberg with 64 percent of the vote. He defeated Vandenberg again in 2004 with 61 percent of the vote. Vandenberg, a college administrator, was again Calvert's opponent in the November 2006 election.[http://www.vandenbergforcongress.com/] Calvert won with 59.6 percent of the vote; Vandenburg got 37.5 percent.<ref>California Secretary of State, [http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/4400.htm 2006 general election results], U.S. Congress District 44.

He ran against Democratic candidate [[Bill Hedrick]], receiving 51.8% of the vote.<ref>California Secretary of State, [http://vote.sos.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/4459.htm 2008 general election results]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, U.S. Congress District 44.

Calvert is the original author of E-Verify, the only employment verification program available to employers to check the work authorization status of newly hired employees.  In 1995, Rep.

Calvert's real estate firm, where Calvert's brother, Quint, is the president,<ref name=\"PE-8-17-06\">David Danelski and Sandra Stokely, [http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_D_calvert18.3c5082e.html \"Sale of park site draws questions\"], ''Press-Enterprise'', August 17, 2006</ref> and Halpole is vice president, received brokerage fees from the seller, Rod Smith of [[Greeley, Colorado]], for representing both buyer and seller in the deal. Less than a year later, Calvert and Harpole sold the property for nearly $1 million. During the time he owned the land, Calvert used the earmarking process to secure $8 million in federal funds for a freeway interchange {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the property, and an additional $1.5 million to support commercial development of the area around the base.\n\nIn early summer 2005, Harpole bought property with a group of investors at 20330 Temescal Canyon Road, a few blocks from the site of the what was then a proposed interchange at Cajalco and I-15. The purchase price was $975,000. Within six months, after the bill passed that provided federal funding for the interchange, they sold the parcel for $1.45 million. Calvert's firm took a commission on the sale.<ref name=\"LAT-5-15-06\"/>\n\nOn May 19, 2006, [[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Riverside Press-Enterprise]], the sixth largest newspaper in California, editorialized that The Los Angeles Times got the facts wrong and in fact, there was no impropriety on the part of Rep. Calvert.<ref>The Riverside Press Enterprise Editorial \"False Alarm\" May 19, 2006</ref>  Rep. Calvert has stated that all requests for federal funding come from local entities.\n\n===Jurupa Community Services District===\nIn the spring of 2006, Calvert and Harpole purchased {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of land from Jurupa Community Services District (JCSD), a water and sewer district in northwestern Riverside County, for $1.2 million, along with five investment partners who jointly had a one-third interest. A newspaper investigation reported in August 2006 that the district apparently never first offered the land to other public agencies, a requirement of state law intended to provide more recreational land. The district's general manager said other agencies were notified, but representatives of those agencies said they received no such notice. The district could not provide evidence of the notification, saying relevant files had been misplaced.\n\nThe community services district did not advertise or list the land for sale, a practice required by counties and many other public agencies seeking top dollar on behalf of taxpayers. District general manager Carole McGreevy, who is stepping down from that position in late 2006 and retiring in late 2007, said the district proclaimed the land surplus in the early 1990s after it was no longer needed for flood control. The record of that decision was among the missing documents, as was the updated appraisal that McGreevy said was done in May 2005.\n\nThe Calvert partnership plans to build a mini-storage business.<ref name=\"PE-8-17-06\"/> In August 2008, the Jurupa Area Recreation and Parks District (JARPD) filed a lawsuit against JCSD, alleging fraud in the sale of the land.  In August 2009, the FBI was looking into the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Calvert said he had not been contacted by the FBI or a grand jury and did not believe that he was a focus of any investigation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rep.
