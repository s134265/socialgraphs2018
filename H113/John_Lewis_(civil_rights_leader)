He is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|GA|5}}, serving since 1987, and is the dean of the [[United States congressional delegations from Georgia|Georgia congressional delegation]]. The district includes the northern three-quarters of [[Atlanta]].\n\nLewis is the only living \"[[Big Six (civil rights)|Big Six]]\" leader of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955\u20131968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], having been the chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), playing a key role in the struggle to end legalized racial [[discrimination]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Lewis is a member of the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives and has served in the [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] organization since shortly after his first election to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].\n\nHe is Senior Chief Deputy Whip, leading an organization of chief deputy whips and serves as the primary assistant to the Democratic Whip. He has held this position since 2007 and been on the whip team since 1991.\n\n==Early life==\nLewis was born in [[Troy, Alabama]], the third son of Willie Mae (n\u00e9e Carter) and Eddie Lewis.<ref name=fid1>Stated on ''Finding Your Roots'', PBS, March 25, 2012</ref> His parents were [[sharecroppers]].<ref name=ReportingCivilRights>''Reporting Civil Rights: American Journalism 1963\u20131973, Part Two ''Carson, Clayborne, Garrow, David, Kovach, Polsgrove, Carol (Editorial Advisory Board), (Library of America: February 2003) ISBN=978-1-931082-29-7 pp. 15\u201316, 48, 56, 84, 323, 374, 384, 392, 491\u201394, 503, 505, 513, 556, 726, 751, 846, 873</ref> Lewis grew up in [[Pike County, Alabama]].

While a student, he was invited to attend [[non-violence]] workshops held in the basement of Clark Memorial United Methodist Church by the Rev. [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]] and Rev. [[Kelly Miller Smith]]. There he became a dedicated adherent to the discipline and philosophy of non-violence, which he still practices today. The Nashville sit-in movement was responsible for the desegregation of lunch counters in downtown Nashville. Lewis was arrested and jailed many times in the struggle to desegregate the downtown area of the city. Afterwards, he participated in the [[Freedom Rides]] sponsored by the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] or CORE, led by [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] and ultimately became a national leader in the struggle for civil rights and respect for human dignity.<ref name=ReportingCivilRights/> In an interview, John Lewis said \"I saw racial discrimination as a young child. I saw those signs that said \"White Men, Colored Men, White Women, Colored Women.\"...\"I remember as a young child with some of my brothers and sisters and first cousins going down to the public library trying to get library cards, trying to check some books out, and we were told by the librarian that the library was for whites only and not for \"coloreds.\" During a rather dangerous childhood trip to Buffalo, NY, John saw for the first time black men and white men working together, unsegregated water fountains, and for the first time, John began to believe the dream of equality was more than just a dream. Lewis followed [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr]] and [[Rosa Parks]] on the radio. He and his family supported the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Civil rights activism==\nJohn Lewis was the youngest of the [[Big Six (civil rights)|Big Six]] civil rights leaders and the chairman of the [[SNCC]] from 1963 to 1966, some of the most tumultuous years of the civil rights movement. During his tenure, SNC opened Freedom Schools, launched the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], and organized the voter registration efforts that led to the pivotal [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. As the chairmen of SNCC, Lewis had written a speech in reaction to the Civil Rights Bill of 1963. He denounced the bill because it didn't protect African Americans against police brutality nor did the bill provide African Americans the right to vote.\n\nHe graduated from the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville and then received a bachelor's degree in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk University. As a student, Lewis was very dedicated to the [[civil rights movement]]. He organized [[sit-ins]] at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the [[Nashville sit-ins|Nashville Student Movement]]. He was instrumental in organizing student sit-ins, bus [[boycotts]] and [[nonviolent]] protests in the fight for voter and racial equality.\n\nIn 1960, Lewis became one of the 13 original [[Freedom Riders]]. There were seven whites and six blacks who were determined to ride from Washington, DC, to New Orleans in an integrated fashion. At that time, several states of the old Confederacy still enforced laws prohibiting black and white riders from sitting next to each other on public transportation. The Freedom Ride, originated by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and revived by Farmer and CORE, was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960) that declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. In the South, Lewis and other non-violent Freedom Riders were beaten by angry mobs, arrested at times and taken to jail. When CORE gave up on the Freedom Ride because of the violence, Lewis and fellow activist [[Diane Nash]] arranged for the Nashville students to take it over and bring it to a successful conclusion.\n\nIn 1963, when Chuck McDew stepped down as SNCC chairman, Lewis, one of the founding members of SNCC, was quickly elected to take over. Lewis's experience at that point was already widely respected. His courage and his tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and non-violence made him emerge as a leader. By this time, he had been arrested 24 times in the non-violent struggle for equal justice. He held the post of chairman until 1966.\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march) - NARA - 542056.jpg|thumb|left|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march)]]\n\nBy 1963, he was recognized as one of the \"[[Big Six (civil rights)|Big Six]]\" leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, along with [[Whitney Young]], [[A. Phillip Randolph]], [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] and [[Roy Wilkins]]. In that year, Lewis helped plan the historic [[March on Washington]] in August 1963, the occasion of Dr. King's celebrated \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. Currently, he is the last remaining speaker from the march. Lewis represented SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and at 23 was the youngest speaker that day.<ref name=\"scholastic\">{{cite news|title=The Sixties|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Junior Scholastic]]|date=February 11, 1994|page=6|accessdate=December 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Lewis coordinated SNCC's efforts for \"[[Mississippi Freedom Summer]],\" a campaign to register black voters across the South. The Freedom Summer was an attempt to expose college students from around the country to the perils of African-American life in the South. Lewis traveled the country encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people in Mississippi, the most recalcitrant state in the union, to register and vote. Lewis became nationally known during his prominent role in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. On March 7, 1965 \u2013 a day that would become known as \"[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]\" \u2013 Lewis and fellow activist [[Hosea Williams]] led over 600 marchers across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. At the end of the bridge, they were met by [[Alabama Highway Patrol|Alabama State Troopers]] who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged [[tear gas]] and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with night sticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he escaped across the bridge, to a church in Selma. Before he could be taken to the hospital, John Lewis appeared before the television cameras calling on [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] to intervene in Alabama. On his head, Lewis bears scars that are still visible today.\n\nHistorian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote: \"At the great Washington March of 1963, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), John Lewis, speaking to the same enormous crowd that heard [[Martin Luther King]]'s ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, was prepared to ask the right question: 'Which side is the federal government on?' That sentence was eliminated from his speech by organizers of the March to avoid offending the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy Administration]]. But Lewis and his fellow SNCC workers had experienced, again and again, the strange passivity of the national government in the face of Southern violence.\"<ref name=FreedomAlbany>{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|title=My Name Is Freedom Albany, Georgia|format=reprint|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|location=Boston|work=You Can't Be Neutral on A Moving Train}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Rustin Young Ryan Farmer Lewis.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis (far right) with [[Bayard Rustin]], [[Andrew Young]], [[William Fitts Ryan]], and [[James L. Farmer, Jr.]]]]\n\n\"John Lewis and SNCC had reason to be angry. At 21 years old, John Lewis was the first of the Freedom Riders to be assaulted while in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]]. He tried to enter a whites-only waiting room and two white men attacked him, injuring his face and kicking him in the ribs. Nevertheless, only two weeks later Lewis joined a ''Freedom Ride'' that was bound for Jackson. \"We were determined not to let any act of violence keep us from our goal. We knew our lives could be threatened, but we had made up our minds not to turn back,\" Lewis said recently in regard to his perseverance following the act of violence.<ref name=SmithsonianMagazine>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Freedom-Riders.html?c=y&page=1|title=The Freedom Riders, Then and Now|work=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with [[CNN]] during the 40th anniversary of the Freedom Rides, Lewis recounted the sheer amount of violence he and the 12 other original Freedom Riders endured. In [[Anniston, Alabama]], the bus was fire-bombed after [[Ku Klux Klan]] members deflated its tires, forcing it to come to a stop. In [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], the Riders were mercilessly beaten, and in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], an angry mob met the bus, and Lewis was hit in the head with a wooden crate. \"It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the [[Greyhound bus]] station in Montgomery unconscious,\" said Lewis, remembering the incident.\n[[Image:John Lewis 1964-04-16.jpg|thumb|100px|Lewis at meeting of [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]], 1964]] \nThe original intent of the Freedom Rides was to test the new law that banned segregation in public transportation.
