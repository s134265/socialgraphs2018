She writes of that time, \"I took every baby sitting job I could get, because by ninth grade, I was growing conscious of my appearance.

She says it was because she wanted to change the tax code, \"from the inside out.\" She also commented on her role as a [[Tea Party Movement|Tea Party leader]]. \"I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I now realize that I misspoke,\" she admitted. \"I should have said 100 percent, because I believe that nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] offers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/45356522/ns/today-books/t/core-conviction-michele-bachmann-tells-her-story/#.TuQcAE-iIiw |title=\u2018Core of Conviction\u2019: Michele Bachmann tells her story - books - TODAY.com |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/1123/Michele-Bachmann-shares-her-life-story-with-voters-in-Core-of-Conviction/%28page%29/2 |title=Michele Bachmann shares her life story with voters in 'Core of Conviction' |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/novemberweb-only/michele-bachmann.html |title=Michele Bachmann: 'It's High Time We Have a Mother in the White House' &#124; Christianity Today &#124; A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction |publisher=Christianity Today |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[US Congressional Delegations from Minnesota]]\n* [[List of United States Representatives from Minnesota]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em|refs=\n<ref name=\"paul harris\">{{cite news | author=Harris, Paul | title = America's Miss Right; Right-wing America finds a new heroine to take up the battle against liberalism | work=The Observer | date = November 15, 2009 | page = 2 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/15/michele-bachmann-president-sarah-palin | accessdate =January 12, 2010 | location=London}} Also published as:\n* {{cite news | author=Harris, Paul | title = Firebrands of the American right | work=The Guardian Weekly | volume = 181 | issue = 24 | date = November 27, 2009 | page = 28}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://bachmann.house.gov/ Official website] at U.S. Congress\n* [http://www.michelebachmann.com/ Official campaign website]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Minnesota/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Michele_Bachmann_%5BR-6%5D}}\n* [http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michele-bachmann/ Politifact.com File on Michele Bachmann]\n* {{MN-legdb|10026}}\n* {{CongLinks|congbio=b001256|votesmart=54675|washpo=gIQALIcw9O|govtrack=412216|opencong=412216_Michele_Bachmann|ontheissuespath=House/Michele_Bachmann.htm|surge=991|legistorm=823/Rep_Michele_Bachmann.html|fec=H6MN06074|opensecrets=N00027493|followthemoney=7596|cspan=1021492|rose=|imdb=2939627|nyt=b/michele_m_bachmann|guardian=world/michele-bachmann|worldcat=np-bachmann,%20michele|nndb=017/000122648}}\n* [http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=2008&type=I&cid=N00027493&newMem=N 2008 campaign finance data from OpenSecrets.org]\n* [http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00027493&cycle=2010 2010 campaign finance data from OpenSecrets.org]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-mn-sen}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Gary W.
