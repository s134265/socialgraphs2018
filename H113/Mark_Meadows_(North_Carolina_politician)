He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Early life, education, and business career==\nMeadows was born in [[Verdun]], [[France]] and grew up in [[Brandon, Florida]].  He graduated from the [[University of South Florida]] after briefly studying at [[Florida State University]]. During his collegiate years, Meadows joined [[Sigma Chi Fraternity]].

The district had been significantly altered in [[gerrymandering|redistricting]].  New lines were drawn straight through the middle of Warren Wilson College. Notably, it lost most of [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] to the [[North Carolina's 10th congressional district|10th district]], while picking up some heavily Republican territory in the foothills.  The old 11th had a slight Republican lean, but the new 11th was on paper the most Republican district in the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In 2011, the North Carolina state legislature re-drew the congressional districts in 2011 based on updated population information from the 2010 census.<ref name=\"redistricting\" /> As a result the district is now 91.2% White, 3.0% Black, 1.4% Native American and 1.0% Asian.<ref name=\"redistricting\">[http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/North_Carolina's_11th_congressional_district North Carolina's 11th congressional district: Race]</ref> District 11 now includes the counties of Buncombe (Asheville), Clay, Cherokee, Graham, Haywood (Waynesville), Henderson (Hendersonville), Jackson (Sylva), Macon (Franklin), McDowell (Marion), Madison, Polk, Swain, Transylvania (Brevard) and Yancey (Burnsville).<ref>[http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/images/c/c2/NC11.jpg NC11 Map]</ref><ref group=\"Notes\">District 10, with three counties, (Burke (Morganton), Mitchell and Rutherford) that border on District 11, also includes the counties of Avery, Caldwell, Catawba (Hickory and Newton), Cleveland (Shelby), Gaston (Gastonia) and Lincoln (Lincolnton).</ref>\n\nHe won the Republican primary runoff, in July 2012,<ref>{{cite news|title=Mark Meadows sweeps 11th congressional GOP run-off|url=http://www.maconnews.com/news/state--region/3317-mark-meadows-sweeps-11th-congressional-gop-run-off|accessdate=31 August 2012|newspaper=The Macon County News|date=19 July 2012|author=Parker, Brittney}}</ref> and in the general election in November, faced the Democratic candidate, Hayden Rogers, who had been Shuler's chief of staff.
