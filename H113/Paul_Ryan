Bush administration]] as being inconsistent with fiscal conservatism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref name=\"Auto2A-55\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-56\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-57\"/> In 2011 President [[Barack Obama]] criticized Ryan as being \"not on the level\" for describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two \"unpaid for\" wars.<ref name=\"Auto2A-58\"/> Columnist [[Ezra Klein]] wrote in 2012 that \"If you know about Paul Ryan at all, you probably know him as a deficit hawk. But Ryan has voted to increase deficits and expand government spending too many times for that to be his north star.\"<ref name=\"Auto2A-59\"/>\n\nObama initially viewed Ryan as a Republican who could help to reduce the federal deficit. Speaking of Ryan's budget proposal, Obama called it a \"serious proposal\" and found both points of agreement and disagreement, saying \"some ideas in there that I would agree with, but there are some ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them.\"<ref name=\"Auto2A-60\"/>\n\nIn 1999, Ryan voted in favor of the [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]], which repealed certain provisions of the [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] [[Banking Act of 1933|Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] that [[Financial regulation|regulated banking]].<ref name=\"GBLA\"/> Ryan sponsored a 2008 bill that would repeal the requirement that the [[Federal Reserve System]] reduce unemployment.<ref name=\"washingtonpost1\" /> Ryan voted to extend unemployment insurance in 2002, 2008 and 2009, but has voted against further extensions since then.<ref name=\"Auto2A-61\"/> Ryan voted against the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]].<ref name=\"Auto2A-62\"/> Ryan also voted against the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] and the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], which Ryan characterized as \"[[class conflict|class warfare]]\".<ref name=\"Auto2A-63\"/>\n\nRyan voted against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health care reform act]] supported by Obama and congressional Democrats in 2010,<ref name=VoteSmart /><ref name=\"USH RC 2010-165\"/> and to repeal it in 2012.<ref name=\"pear\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-64\"/>\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose the [[Social Security debate in the United States|privatization of Social Security]]. Ryan's proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain the support of the then-Republican presidential administration.<ref name=Fussbudget />\n\nRick Hess of the [[American Enterprise Institute]] notes that on \"'education, training, employment, and social services,' the Ryan budget would spend 33% less\" than Obama's budget plan over the next decade.<ref name=\"Auto2A-65\"/> In particular, the Ryan plan tightens eligibility requirements for [[Pell Grants]] and freezes the maximum Pell Grant award at the current level. According to an analysis by the Education Trust, this would result in more than 1 million students losing Pell Grants over the next 10 years. Additionally, under Ryan's plan, student loans would begin to accrue interest while students are still in school.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-66\"/><ref name=Weissman /> Ryan states that his education policy is to \"allocate our limited financial resources effectively and efficiently to improve education\".<ref name=\"Auto2A-67\"/> Jordan Weissmann of ''The Atlantic'' said that Ryan's vision on education policy is to \"cut and privatize\".<ref name=\"Weissman\"/>\n\nRyan voted for the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] in 2001.<ref name=\"Strauss\"/> Ryan is a supporter of [[for-profit college]]s and opposed the [[gainful employment]] rule, which would have ensured that vocational schools whose students were unable to obtain employment would stop receiving federal aid.<ref name=\"Weissman\" /> Ryan is a supporter of private [[school voucher]]s and voted to extend the [[D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program]] in 2011.<ref name=\"Weissman\" /> The [[National Education Association]] teachers' union has criticized Ryan's positions on education.<ref name=\"Strauss\" />{{vague|date=August 2012|reason=What did they criticise? It's not clear that it has any connection to what has already been said}}\n\nRyan has consistently supported giving the president [[Line-item veto in the United States|line-item veto power]].<ref name=\"washingtonpost1\" />\n\nIn the fall of 2013 Ryan suggested using discussions regarding raising the federal debt ceiling as \"leverage\" to reduce federal spending.<ref name=\"Auto2A-68\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-69\"/>\n\nRyan supported a group of three budget reform bills that were considered in the House during the [[113th United States Congress]]. Ryan supported the [[Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress)|Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013]], a bill that would require the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.<ref name=\"1874cbo\"/> He also supported the [[Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress)|Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014]], a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs.<ref name=\"1872cbo\"/> H.R. 1872 would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].<ref name=\"1872cbo\" /> H.R. 1872 would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].<ref name=\"1872cbo\" /> The changes made by H.R. 1872 would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.<ref name=\"Housepushbudgetreform\"/> These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the [[United States federal budget]] would be. The goal of H.R. 1872 is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.<ref name=\"bringoutbudget\"/> Finally, Ryan supported the [[Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress)|Baseline Reform Act of 2013]], a bill that would change the way in which discretionary [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] for individual accounts are projected in CBO's [[Baseline (budgeting)|baseline]].<ref name=\"cbo1871\" /> Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current year's appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation going forward.<ref name=\"cbo1871\"/> Arguing in favor of H.R. 1871, Ryan said that \"families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington.\"<ref name=\"GohmertPRMay9\"/> Ryan said that these three budget reform bills \"are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington.\"<ref name=\"Housepushbudgetreform\" /> Ryan said that he thought \"by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem.\"<ref name=\"Housepushbudgetreform\" />\n\n==== Budget proposals ====\n{{Main|The Path to Prosperity | U.S. House Fiscal Year 2014 Budget (H.

This alternative budget would have eliminated the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and imposed a five-year spending freeze on all [[discretionary spending]].<ref name=\"Auto2A-74\"/><ref name=\"Hulse\"/>  It would have also phased out Medicare's traditional fee-for-service model; instead it would offer fixed sums in the form of [[vouchers]] for those under the age of 55, with which Medicare beneficiaries could buy private insurance.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Ryan's proposed budget would also have allowed taxpayers to opt out of the federal income taxation system with [[itemized deduction]]s, and instead pay a [[Flat tax|flat]] 10 percent of [[adjusted gross income]] up to $100,000 for couples ($50,000 for singles) and 25 percent on any remaining income.<ref name=Hulse /> It was ultimately rejected in the Democratic controlled House by a vote of 293\u2013137, with 38 Republicans in opposition.<ref name=\"Auto2A-75\"/>\n\nOn January 27, 2010, Ryan released a modified version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010.<ref name=\"Auto2A-76\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-77\"/> The modified plan would provide across-the-board [[tax cuts]] by reducing [[Income tax in the United States|income tax rates]]; eliminate income taxes on [[capital gain]]s, dividends, and interest; and abolish the [[estate tax]], and [[Alternative Minimum Tax]]. The plan would also replace the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%.<ref name=\"roadmap2\"/> The plan would [[Privatization|privatize]] a portion of Social Security,<ref name=\"Ambinder\"/><ref name=\"Klein\"/> eliminate the tax exclusion for [[employer-sponsored health insurance]],<ref name=Klein /> and privatize Medicare for those under the age of 55.<ref name=Ambinder /><ref name=Klein /> Chief actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's \"Roadmap\" with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had \"some potential\" to make healthcare prices \"more sustainable\", he was more \"confident\" in Ryan's plan.<ref name=\"Auto2A-78\"/>\n\nEconomist and columnist [[Paul Krugman]] criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/> Krugman further called the plan a \"fraud\" saying it relies on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and \"dismantling Medicare as we know it\" by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995.<ref name=\"Krugman\" /> In contrast, columnist [[Ramesh Ponnuru]], writing in the ''National Review'', argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets.<ref name=\"Mythmakers\"/> Economist [[Ted Gayer]] wrote that \"Ryan's vision of broad-based [[tax reform]], which essentially would shift us toward a [[consumption tax]]... makes a useful contribution to this debate.\"<ref name=\"Auto2A-79\"/>\n\nIn subsequent years, Ryan also developed budget plans that proposed privatizing Medicare for those currently under the age of 55,<ref name=\"Auto2A-80\"/> funding [[Medicaid]] and the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] through [[block grant]]s to the states,<ref name=\"Fussbudget\"/><ref name=\"Luhby\"/><ref name=\"Fox08112012\"/> and other changes.\n\nOn April 11, 2011, Ryan introduced [[Concurrent resolution|H.Con.Res.]] 34, a federal budget for fiscal year 2012.<ref name=\"Auto2A-81\"/> The House passed this [[The Path to Prosperity|Ryan Plan]] on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235\u2013193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it.<ref name=\"Auto2A-82\"/><ref name=\"AP Ryan Plan Vote\"/> A month later, the bill was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 57\u201340, with five Republicans and most Democrats in opposition.<ref name=\"CNN Ryan Vote\"/>\n\n[[File:Paul Ryan with Barack Obama 02-25-10.jpg|right|thumb|Ryan with President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] during a bipartisan meeting on health insurance reform, February 25, 2010]]\nOn March 23, 2012 Ryan introduced a new version of his federal budget for the fiscal year 2013.<ref name=\"Auto2A-83\"/> On March 29, 2012, the House of Representatives passed the resolution along partisan lines, 228 yeas to 191 nays; ten Republicans voted against the bill, along with all the House Democrats.<ref name=\"Auto2A-84\"/> Ryan's budget seeks to reduce all discretionary spending in the budget from 12.5% of GDP in 2011 to 3.75% of GDP in 2050.<ref name=\"ezra\"/>\n\nRyan has proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on the number of people who qualify.  His plan would also undo a [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover [[long-term care]].<ref name=Fussbudget /><ref name=\"Luhby\" /><ref name=\"Fox08112012\" /><ref name=\"Lilly\"/>\n\nAn analysis by the CBO showed that the Ryan plan would not balance the budget for at least 28 years, partly because the changes in Medicare would not affect anyone now older than 55.<ref name=\"Auto2A-85\"/> Former [[Comptroller General of the United States|U.S. Comptroller General]] [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]] and [[Maya MacGuineas]], president of the [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]], praised the budget for making tough choices. Walker believes it needs to go even further, tackling Social Security and defense spending.<ref name=\"Auto2A-86\"/> In contrast, [[David Stockman]], Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] under President Ronald Reagan, has declared that Ryan's budget \"is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices\" and would \"do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse\".<ref name=\"Auto2A-87\"/> Ezra Klein also criticized the budget for making \"unrealistic assumptions\".<ref name=ezra /> The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] was highly critical of Ryan's budget proposal, stating that it would shift income to the wealthy while increasing poverty and inequality.<ref name=\"Auto2A-88\"/>\n\nParts of the 2012 Ryan budget were criticized by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] for its proposed cuts to housing and food stamp programs.<ref name=\"Auto2A-89\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-90\"/> Faculty and administrators of Georgetown University challenged what they called Ryan's \"continuing misuse of [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic teaching]]\" when defending his plan,<ref name=\"Auto2A-91\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-92\"/> but Ryan rejected their criticism.<ref name=\"Auto2A-93\"/>\n\nIn March 2013, Ryan submitted a new budget plan for Fiscal Year 2014 to the House.  It would set to balance the budget by 2023 by repealing Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and institute federal vouchers into Medicare.\n<ref name=\"Auto2A-94\"/> Ryan has cited health care, education and food safety as examples of \"runaway\" federal spending.<ref name=\"Auto2A-95\"/> This budget, [[U.S. House Fiscal Year 2014 Budget (H. Con. Res. 25; 113th Congress)|House Concurrent Resolution 25]], was voted on by the House on March 21, 2013 and it passed 221-207.<ref name=\"Auto2A-96\"/> In 2014, Ryan released a refresh of this plan which would reduce spending by 5.1 trillion over a decade; balancing the budget by 2024.<ref name=\"Auto2A-97\"/>\n\nOn December 10, 2013, Ryan announced that he and Democratic Senator [[Patty Murray]] had reached a compromise agreement on a two-year, bipartisan budget bill, called the [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013]]. The deal would cap the federal government's spending for Fiscal Year 2014 at $1.012 trillion and for Fiscal Year 2015 at $1.014.<ref name=\"CNNplainenglish\"/> The proposed deal would eliminate some of the spending cuts required by the sequester ($45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January 2014 and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015).<ref name=\"CNNplainenglish\" /> The deal offsets the spending increases by raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers.<ref name=\"positivereviewHill\" /> Overall the fee increases and spending reductions total about $85 billion over a decade.<ref name=\"Auto2A-98\"/> Ryan said that he was \"proud\" of the agreement because \"it reduces the deficit \u2013 without raising taxes.\"<ref name=\"whatsinitKlein\"/>\n\nSome conservative Republicans objected to Ryan's budget proposal. Republican [[Raul Labrador]] criticized the \"terrible plan,\" saying that \"it makes promises to the American people that are false. Today the Democrats realized they were right all along, that we would never hold the line on the sequester.\"  Other conservatives were more positive: \u201cIt achieves most of the things we would like to see when we have divided government,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).<ref name=\"positivereviewHill\" />\n\nRyan's proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 included deep cuts to domestic spending to reduce projected federal deficits by about $5 trillion over the next decade.  In releasing the budget, Ryan stated \"We have to stop spending money we don't have.\"  According to the [[White House]], Ryan's 2014 budget proposal would increase taxes on middle-class families by an average of $2000, while cutting taxes for the richest Americans.<ref name=\"Auto2A-99\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-100\"/>\n\n=== Social, environmental, and science issues ===\nIn 2010, Ryan described himself as being \"as [[pro-life]] as a person gets\"<ref name=\"WeeklyStand-7192010\"/> and has been described as an \"ardent, unwavering foe of [[abortion rights]]\".<ref name=\"NYT-PearSocial\" /> As of 2012 according to ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', Ryan has co-sponsored 38 measures in the U.S. Congress that restrict abortion.<ref name=\"Bloomberg-822\"/> The [[National Right to Life Committee]] has consistently given Ryan a \"100 percent pro-life voting record\" since he took office in 1999. [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] has noted that Ryan has \"cast 59 votes\" (including procedural motions and amendments which don't have co-sponsors<ref name=Bloomberg-822 />) \"on reproductive rights while in Congress and not one has been pro-choice\".<ref name=\"Auto2A-101\"/> He believes all abortions should be illegal, including those resulting from rape or [[incest]], and only makes an exception for cases where the woman's life is at risk.<ref name=\"Beast08122012\" /><ref name=\"FiveIssues\"/>\n\nDuring Ryan's 1998 campaign for Congress, he \"expressed his willingness to let states criminally prosecute women who have abortions,\" telling the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' at the time that he \"would let states decide what criminal penalties would be attached to abortions\", and while not stating that he supports jailing women who have an abortion, stated: \"if it's illegal, it's illegal.\"<ref name=\"Beast08122012\"/> In 2009, he cosponsored the [[Sanctity of Life Act]], which would provide that fertilized eggs \"shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of [[beginning of human personhood|personhood]]\" and would have given \"the Congress, each State, the District of Columbia, and all United States territories \u2026 the authority to protect the lives of all human beings residing in its respective jurisdictions\".<ref name=\"Auto2A-102\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-103\"/><ref name=\"Hartfield\"/>\n\nRyan has also supported legislation that would impose criminal penalties for certain doctors who perform \"[[partial-birth abortion]]s\".<ref name=\"NYT-PearSocial\" /> Ryan voted against continued federal aid for [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[Title X]] [[family planning]] programs.<ref name=\"NYT-PearSocial\" /><ref name=\"Auto2A-104\"/> He also opposed giving [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter status]] for [[Emergency contraception#Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)|emergency contraceptive pills]].<ref name=VoteSmart /><ref name=\"Auto2A-105\"/> Ryan was one of 227 co-sponsors of the 2011 [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]] bill in the House of Representatives that would have limited funding for federally funded abortions to victims of \"forcible rape\". \"Forcible rape\" was not defined in the bill, which critics said would result in excluding date rape, statutory rape, or other situations where the victim had diminished mental capacity. The language was removed from the bill before the House passed the bill, the Senate did not vote on the bill.<ref name=\"Auto2A-106\"/>\n\nRyan opposes [[same-sex marriage]], had previously supported a [[Federal Marriage Amendment|constitutional ban on same-sex marriage]], opposed the repeal of the [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy, voted against same-sex couples [[Adoption|adopting children]] in Washington D.C., and voted against a [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act|bill]] that would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation .<ref name=\"NYT-PearSocial\" /><ref name=\"FiveIssues\" /><ref name=\"Auto2A-107\"/> Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] in 2007, which would've prohibited [[employment discrimination]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]].<ref name=\"NYT-PearSocial\" /> The [[Human Rights Campaign]], a [[GLBT rights]] organization, has frequently given Ryan a 0/100 rating on its legislative scorecard.<ref name=\"Auto2A-108\"/> During Paul Ryan's 2012 vice presidential bid, he was endorsed by two [[gay conservative]] organizations, [[GOProud]]<ref name=\"Auto2A-109\"/> and the [[Log Cabin Republicans]].<ref name=\"Auto2A-110\"/> On April 30, 2013, Ryan came out in favor of same-sex couples adopting children. He also said he had always supported [[civil unions]]. He also said that if the [[US Supreme Court]] declares the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] unconstitutional, then he believes it will become a [[federalism|federalist issue]] for states to decide same-sex marriage.<ref name=\"Auto2A-111\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-112\"/>\n\nRyan has supported the rights of gun owners and opposed stricter gun control measures.<ref name=\"NYT-PearSocial\" /><ref name=\"progun\"/> He voted against a bill for stronger background check requirements for purchases at [[gun show]]s and supports federal [[Concealed carry in the United States#Reciprocity|concealed-carry reciprocity]] legislation, which would allow a person with a permit to carry a concealed firearm in one state to carry a firearm in every other state, a top [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) priority.<ref name=\"progun\" /> Ryan, who owns a rifle and a shotgun, is an NRA member, has received an \"A\" rating from the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action and has been endorsed by the organization every cycle he has been in Congress.\n\nRyan favors a [[Flag Desecration Amendment|constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning]]. He also voted to withdraw federal funding of [[NPR]].<ref name=\"NYT-PearSocial\"/>\n\nIn the past, Ryan supported legislation that would have allowed some [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] to apply for temporary [[guest-worker]] status, including one bill that would provide a pathway to [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residence status]] (a Green Card) for such immigrants. However, more recently Ryan \"has adopted a firm anti-amnesty, enforcement-first stance\" on illegal immigration.<ref name=\"Auto2A-113\"/> Ryan voted against the [[DREAM Act]], a bill that would provide conditional permanent residency to illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children if they attend college or serve in the military, and meet other criteria.<ref name=Hartfield /> He also voted in favor of the [[Secure Fence Act of 2006]].<ref name=\"VoteSmart\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-114\"/> Ryan has said \"we must first secure the border and stem the flow of illegal immigration, and then work to increase legal immigration through an enforceable guest worker program\" before pursuing a \"piecemeal\" reform such as the DREAM Act.<ref name=\"Auto2A-115\"/>\n\nRyan opposed the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]], stating that \"it creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse.\"<ref name=\"mashable1\"/>\n\nThe [[League of Conservation Voters]] (LCV), the [[Sierra Club]], and other environmentalists have criticized Ryan's record on [[Environmental policy of the United States|environmental issues]], with Ryan earning 3 percent on the LCV 2011 National Environmental Scorecard.<ref name=\"Zelman\"/> He opposes [[cap and trade]] and opposed the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] of 2009.<ref name=\"2009Ryanoped\" /> In an 2009 editorial, Ryan has accused climatologists of using \"statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change\" and he criticized the EPA's classification of carbon dioxide as a [[Air pollution|pollutant]].<ref name=\"2009Ryanoped\"/> Ryan supports a 10-year $40 billion tax break for the [[petroleum industry]], and has proposed cutting funding for renewable energy research and subsidies.<ref name=\"Auto2A-116\"/>\n\nRyan has spoken out against a \"tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning to value the culture of work.\"<ref name=\"Auto2A-117\"/>\n\n=== War on Poverty report ===\n{{Main|The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later}}\n\nIn February 2013, Ryan began touring low-income neighborhoods and speaking on efforts to reform federal anti-poverty programs.<ref name=\"Auto2A-118\"/>\n\nOn March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Ryan released a report titled ''[[The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later]]'', asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended and that there is little evidence that these efforts have been successful.<ref name=\"WOPReportDocument\"/> In the report, Ryan advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that \"penalize families for getting ahead\" and that  \"the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates,\" both of which \"reduce the incentive to work\".<ref name=\"Auto2A-119\"/> At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs.<ref name=\"WOP_report\"/> In an appendix titled \"Measures of Poverty\", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements \"[have] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones.\"<ref name=\"WOPReportDocument\" /><ref name=\"WOP_report\" /> According to an article in the ''[[Fiscal Times]]'', several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.<ref name=\"Auto2A-120\"/>\n\n=== Foreign and military policy ===\n\nRyan has been described by [[Larry Sabato]] as \"just a generic Republican on foreign policy\".<ref name=\"fisher\"/><ref name=\"reutersforeign\"/>\n\nRyan voted in 2001 and 2004 to end the [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo on Cuba]],<ref name=\"Auto2A-121\"/><ref name=\"Auto2A-122\"/><ref name=\"Keating\"/><ref name=\"Munzenrieder\"/> but later reversed his positions, and, since 2007, has voted for maintaining the embargo.<ref name=\"Munzenrieder\" /> In 2008, Ryan told the ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', \"If we're going to have [[Permanent normal trade relations|free trade with China]], why not Cuba?\"<ref name=\"Keating\" />\n\nRyan was a \"reliable supporter of the [George W. Bush] administration's foreign policy priorities\" who voted for the 2002 [[Iraq Resolution]], authorizing President George W. Bush to use [[2003 invasion of Iraq|military force in Iraq]].<ref name=\"crawford\" /> Ryan also voted for the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]].<ref name=\"crawford\" /> In May 2012, Ryan voted for H.R. 4310,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} which would increase defense spending, including spending for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan War]] and for various weapon systems, to the level of $642 billion&nbsp;\u2013 $8 billion more than previous spending levels.<ref name=\"Auto2A-123\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Ryan termed the Obama administrations' [[Russia\u2013United States relations|\"reset\" of relations with Russia]] as \"[[appeasement]]\".<ref name=\"larison\"/> Daniel Larison of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' wrote that Ryan \"seems to conceive of U.S. power abroad mostly in terms of military strength\" and \"truly is a product of the era of George W. Bush\".<ref name=\"larison\" />\n\nIn 2011, Ryan pointed to his support for over $10 billion in cuts to national security spending as part of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] that included $50 billion in near-term budget cuts and a sequestration system to force further budget cuts.<ref name=\"Auto2A-124\"/> In 2012, Ryan explained his support for defense spending sequestration in the hope that this would open common ground with the Democrats on deficit reduction.<ref name=\"Auto2A-125\"/> In January 2013, he said that sequestration would likely occur because the Democrats offered no alternative.<ref name=\"Auto2A-126\"/> Ryan's comments have led defense industry leaders to pin their final hopes on the chance that Congress will at least allow the Pentagon to reprogram the coming cuts.<ref name=\"Auto2A-127\"/> In March 2013, Ryan outlined a budget that provided $2 trillion less for defense over a ten-year period than the platform he had run on the previous fall.<ref name=\"Auto2A-128\"/>\n\n== 2012 vice presidential campaign ==\n{{See also|Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Republican Party vice presidential candidates, 2012}}\n[[File:Paul Ryan with Mitt Romney in Norfolk, Virginia 8-11-12.jpg|thumb|[[Mitt Romney]] with Paul Ryan after introducing him as his running mate, for the 2012 presidential election, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on August 11, 2012]]\n\n[[Dan Balz]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that Ryan was promoted as a candidate for Vice President \"by major elements of the conservative opinion makers, including ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial page, the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' and the editor of ''National Review''\".<ref name=\"Auto2A-129\"/>\n\nOn August 11, 2012, the Romney campaign officially announced Ryan as its choice for Vice President through its \"Mitt's VP\" [[mobile app]]<ref name=\"Auto2A-130\"/> as well as by the [[social networking service]] Twitter,<ref name=GT-DEX-2012-GOP-34>{{cite web |title=Mitt Romney officially announces Paul Ryan as his choice of Vice President on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/234253751995736064 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> about 90 minutes before Romney's in-person introduction.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Before the official announcement in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], it was reported that Romney made his decision, and offered the position to Ryan on August 1, 2012,<ref name=\"Auto2A-131\"/> the day after returning from a foreign policy trip through the United Kingdom, [[Poland]] and [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Auto2A-132\"/> On August 11, 2012, Ryan formally accepted Romney's invitation to join his campaign as his running mate, in front of the [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] in Norfolk.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Ryan is the major parties' first-ever vice-presidential candidate from [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=\"Auto2A-133\"/>\n\nAccording to a statistical-historical analysis conducted by [[Nate Silver]], \"Ryan is the most conservative Republican member of Congress to be picked for the vice-presidential slot since at least 1900\" and \"is also more conservative than any Democratic nominee [for vice president who previously served in the Congress] was liberal, meaning that he is the furthest from the center\" of any vice presidential candidate chosen from Congress since the turn of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Silver Stats\"/> This analysis, using the [[NOMINATE (scaling method)|DW-NOMINATE]] statistical system,<ref name=\"Silver Stats\" /> has been described as \"one of the more statistically rigorous approaches to Ryan's congressional voting record\".<ref name=\"Mahtesian\"/> Political scientist Eric Schickler commented that while Ryan \"may well be the most conservative vice presidential nominee in decades,\" the NOMINATE methodology \"is not suited to making claims about the relative liberalism or conservatism of politicians\" over a long time span.<ref name=\"Mahtesian\" /> A ''USA Today''/[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll found that 39% thought Ryan was an \"excellent\" or \"pretty good\" vice presidential choice, compared to 42% who felt he was a \"fair\" or \"poor\" choice.<ref name=\"Auto2A-134\"/>\n\nRyan formally accepted his nomination at the [[2012 Republican National Convention]] on August 29, 2012.<ref name=\"Auto2A-135\"/> In his acceptance speech, he promoted Mitt Romney as the presidential candidate,<ref name=\"NationalJournal\"/> supported repeal of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA),<ref name=\"  NationalJournal\" /> said that he and Romney had a plan to generate 12 million new jobs over the ensuing four years,<ref name = NationalJournal /> and promoted founding principles as a solution: \"We will not duck the tough issues\u2014we will lead.
