Before his appointment to this position in 2013, he was Chairman of the HASC Readiness subcommittee during the 112th Congress.\n\nIn 2012, Forbes organized a nationwide listening tour titled \u201cDefending Our Defenders\u201d which was aimed at bringing public awareness to the looming impact of sequestration on national defense. Forbes voted against the measure which threatens to dismantle the military and lead to massive civilian and military layoffs.\n\nForbes has been a longtime proponent for a substantially expanded U.S. Navy. He has also been critical of the Navy\u2019s current 30 Year Shipbuilding Plan, which he believes fails to adequately invest in the ships needed to meet the service\u2019s current minimum force structure requirements. \nHe would outline his opposition to the shipbuilding plan in an op-ed in Politico.[6] In April 2013, Forbes presented an extended argument for why the U.S. must maintain a robust Navy, in which he criticized the lack of funding that had allowed the Navy to slip below the 300-ship threshold.[7]\n\nRep. Forbes is a strong supporter of sustained U.S. engagement in the Asia Pacific. In July 2013, Forbes and three colleagues wrote a letter to National Security Advisor Susan Rice asking the White House to develop an coherent strategy document for its implementation.[8]\nFor his work on behalf of the Armed Services and the men and women who wear the uniform, the Army and Navy have presented their highest civilian awards to the Congressman.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes publicly came out against military action in both Libya and Syria.<ref>[http://forbes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=347488 \"Forbes Releases Statement Opposing Intervention in Syria.\"]</ref> In 2014, Forbes promised to promote President Obama's call for funds for action in Syria.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://wvtf.org/post/military-strikes-against-isis |title=Military Strikes Against ISIS |last1=Stevens |first1=Connie |date=September 15, 2014\n |website=wvtf.org |publisher=[[Virginia Tech]] |accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Forbes voted to hollow out the military with a $1.4 billion cut to operations, maintenance, and training funds.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/05/hasc-debates-sequesters-terrible-dilemma-a-ready-force-or-a-large-one/ |title=HASC Debates Sequestration\u2019s \u2018Terrible Dilemma\u2019: A Ready Force Or A Large One |last1=Freedberg Jr. |first1=Sydney J. |date=7 May 2014 |website=breakingdefense.com |publisher=Breaking Media, Inc. |accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Veterans===\nCongressman Forbes\u2019 district is home to 70,000+ veterans, who make up roughly 10% of his constituency. Forbes has been recognized year in and year out by various veteran organizations for his help to bring veterans\u2019 needs to the forefront of public discourse. Forbes was awarded the prestigious AMVET\u2019s Silver Helmet award in 2013, and was named \u201cLegislator of the Year\u201d by Virginia\u2019s MOAA in 2012.

As one of Congress\u2019 preeminent scholars on China issues, Forbes was invited to speak at Harvard in the spring of 2012 to discuss the emerging Chinese military threat and possible US responses. Congressman Forbes has been a lead voice in addressing Chinese military ambition, cyber threats, contaminated exports, human rights violations, and most recently the attempted acquisition of America\u2019s largest pork company by a Chinese competitor.\n\n===Economy===\nForbes\u2019 economic policy is driven by the idea that fewer taxes and less regulation will lead to the success of more businesses and the creation of more jobs. Forbes has supported the delay, defunding, and full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which he has deemed to be one of the biggest job killers in American history. Forbes\u2019 support and efforts have helped bring companies like Sabra, Amazon, Capital One, Rolls Royce, and General Dynamics to southeastern Virginia. His efforts are also responsible for helping keep a carrier in Hampton Roads which threatened a loss of 8,200 jobs, as well as guiding Ft. lee through the latest BRAC which saw the fort expand its role and impact on the local economy. Forbes has been awarded NAM\u2019s \u201cLegislative Excellence Award\u201d, the NFIB\u2019s \u201cGuardian of Small Business\u201d award, and the US Chamber\u2019s \u201cSpirit of Enterprise\u201d award for his work to protect businesses and bring jobs to his district.\n\n===Government accountability===\nForbes has introduced or cosponsored several pieces of legislation, which aim to hold government more accountable. He is one of only seventeen members of congress to vote against every federal bailout under both the Bush and Obama administrations.

Furthermore, Forbes has introduced a balanced budget amendment, and CAP Act to tie members of Congress\u2019 salaries to spending. \nThe revelation that the National Security Agency was abusing intelligence gathering powers provided them under the PATRIOT and FISA acts, Forbes cosponsored bipartisan legislation which enacts greater accountability and oversight over the agency\u2019s intelligence gathering techniques.\n\n===Defending religious freedom===\nAs Founder and Co-Chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Prayer Caucus, Congressman Forbes leads more than 90 Members of Congress in espousing the ideals of the millions of Americans who believe religion to be an essential component of the United States. Under his leadership, the Congressional Prayer Caucus has led against efforts to remove religious references from the public square, worked to promote prayer and legislation affirming faith in the foundation of America.\n\n===Energy independence===\nOn June 12, 2008 Forbes introduced H.R. 6260, titled \"[[New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence]].\" The bill was offered as a substitute for the entire energy bill and outlined a series of prizes, similar to the [[X-PRIZE]], which would be awarded to a private entity, which completed one of seven tasks related to achieving energy independence. The bill included $14 billion in prizes and $10 billion in grants ($10 billion of which would have supported [[nuclear fusion]] research); provisions to establish a summit to discuss the challenge of energy independence; and creation of a commission to offer recommendations to fulfill the goal of becoming energy independent within 20 years. On June 26, 2009, the bill was offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the Waxman/Markey-sponsored [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]].
