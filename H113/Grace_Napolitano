She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. She previously served in the [[California State Assembly]] and the [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]] City Council.\n\nNapolitano previously represented the [[California's 34th congressional district|34th district]] from 1999 to 2003, and the [[California's 38th congressional district|38th district]] from 2003 to 2013. Due to redistricting, Napolitano ran for, and won re-election in the [[2012 United States elections]] in {{ushr|CA|32}} against Republican candidate David Miller. In the 2014 midterm elections, Napolitano was reelected, defeating Republican challenger Arturo Alas.\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nNapolitano was born and raised in [[Brownsville, Texas]]. After high school, she married and moved with her husband to California where they raised five children.\n\nNapolitano began her political career as a member of the [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]] City Council, winning her first election in 1986 by a mere 28 votes. Four years later she won re-election by the highest margin of votes recorded in city history. In 1989, Napolitano was elevated by her council colleagues to serve as Mayor. During her council tenure, she focused much of her attention on providing access to constituents and on redevelopment and transportation issues to address the city's need for jobs and a more diversified economic base.\n\nNapolitano made her way up through the ranks of [[Ford Motor Company]] for 21 years. Following her retirement in 1992, she was elected to the [[California Assembly]], and became a leader on international trade, environmental protection, transportation and immigration.

Napolitano's experience includes 6 years on the California State Assembly Transportation Committee, and current work on rail safety and congestion relief in the [[San Gabriel Valley]].\n\n===Congressional Mental Health Caucus===\nStatistics showing one in three Latina adolescents contemplated suicide prompted Napolitano to spearhead a school-based Latina adolescent [[mental health]] program in three local middle schools and one high school. She co-chairs the [[Congressional Mental Health Caucus]] with [[Tim Murphy (congressman)|Rep. Tim Murphy]] (R-PA). The bipartisan caucus included more than 70 members during the 108th Congress and over 90 members during the 109th Congress. As co-chair, Napolitano has hosted congressional briefings on children and on veteran's mental health needs, working on proposals to improve VA mental health services. A key priority is legislation to provide mental health parity in health insurance.\n\n===Congressional Hispanic Caucus===\nDuring the 109th Congress, Napolitano served as Chair of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]], which continues to address national education, immigration, health, and civil rights issues, and the impact these policies have on the Hispanic community.\n\n==In the district==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2010}}\n\nShe claims responsibility for a $2.8 million Labor Department grant for precision and computer numeric control (CNC) machinists, $4 million to spur reuse and redevelopment of the Northrop Grumman B-2 facility in Pico Rivera, $1 million for upgrades to Cal Poly Pomona's Aerospace Engineering Laboratory Facilities, and $1 million for Central Atmospheric Monitoring Systems in Navy Submarines.

To date, $1.6 million has been secured for this program now operating in 4 local schools.\n\nIn 2011, Napolitano voted against the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362?page=1 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref>\n\n===Health Task Force===\nNapolitano established a district Health Task Force composed of health providers, educators and experts throughout the local area. The Task Force helps keep the Congresswoman apprised of key health issues facing her constituents and works with the Congresswoman to devise programs and projects to improve health care and health outcomes for the local area. The Congresswoman also works with the Health Task Force to pursue funding options through California's Proposition 63 Mental Health Services Expansion and for additional training of nursing professionals at both the entry level (CNAs and LVNs) and RNs with advanced degrees.\n\n===Manufacturing Task Force===\nThe Congresswoman has initiated a Manufacturing Task Force in her district, composed of various small and mid-sized companies.

Prominent among these events are the annual [[Congressional Art Competition]] and Women of the Year recognition ceremonies.\n\n==Coverage by Mainstream Media==\nA 2009 story first reported by Bloomberg News<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aUZXCuqGb_Lw#| title = California's Napolitano Makes $220,000 From 1998 Campaign Loan. | date = 2009-02-13 | accessdate = 2009-02-13 | work=Bloomberg}}</ref> and further detailed by the Los Angeles Times<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/14/local/me-napolitano14|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>  questioned the personal loan interest rate that the [[Federal Election Commission]] had authorized her to use during her initial 1998 run for Congress.  Both Bloomberg and the Times noted that the FEC had accepted the argument that the eighteen percent rate was equivalent to the early withdrawal penalty that Napolitano was subject to by withdrawing $150,000 from her employee retirement fund and then loaning those funds to her campaign.  Both sources also reported the rate dropping to ten percent in 2006, and cited FEC filings as of December 31, 2009 indicating that $221,780 in interest had been paid.  [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]], a Washington DC based newspaper, reported that Federal Election Commission filings<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00334706|publisher=Federal Election Commission|accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref> for the campaign reporting period ending September 30, 2010 had indicated that the debt had been completed retired.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/1007-other/217681-report-members-of-congress-keep-money-in-the-family| title = Report: Members of Congress find ways to keep money in the family | date = 2012-03-22 | accessdate = 2012-04-02 | work=The Hill}}</ref>  The story was again referenced by CBS News in a 60 Minutes episode in October 2013.  This was the first such time that the Congresswoman responded firsthand, where she countered the media's implication that she had personally benefited from the loan, stating \u201cIt isn\u2019t like I\u2019ve really profited. I still live in the same house. I drive a small car. I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.\u201d\n\nIn January 2011, CNN State of the Union featured Napolitano<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawmakers: Close look needed at mental health issues|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/16/lawmakers-close-look-needed-at-mental-health-issues/|publisher=CNN}}</ref>  as part of a bipartisan panel alongside Republican [[Timothy F. Murphy|Tim Murphy]] to discuss adolescent mental illness in the wake of the January 8, 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona that resulted in the deaths of six and wounding of nineteen, including Arizona Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]].  Asked why there wasn't more coverage of the mental health issues outside of this and other gun violence tragedies, Napolitano Napolitano told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. \"Unfortunately it does not hit the radar scope in Washington or almost in any state house ... It's always something you don't talk about, you don't discuss because of the stigma, and I think we need to address that heavily.\"\n\nIn February, 2011, MSNBC's NewsNation interviewed Napolitano alongside LA Lakers basketball player [[Ron Artest]] to discuss her introduction of HR 751, the Mental Health in Schools Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L7_UB7pMs|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>   When asked why she was focusing her attention on mental health issues, she explained her experience with a successful local pilot initiative partnering with the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), however noted that securing funding was challenging despite recent violent school tragedies, saying \"Children don't vote - and to me that's a crime because our children need help and we need to provide it for them.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nNapolitano is married to Frank Napolitano, retired restaurateur and community activist. They have five grown children, fourteen grandchildren, and one great grandson. She is not related to former [[Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Janet Napolitano]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|Author:Graciela Flores Napolitano}}\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.napolitano.house.gov/ Congressman Grace Napolitano] official U.S. House site\n* [http://www.napolitanoforcongress.com/ Grace Napolitano for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/California/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Grace_Napolitano_%5BD-32%5D}}\n*{{CongLinks | congbio = n000179 | ballot = Grace_Napolitano | nndb = 071/000039951 | votesmart = 8393 | govtrack = 400290 | opencong = 400290 | rollcall = 61 | politifact = | fec = H8CA34068 | opensecrets = N00006789 | assets = grace-napolitano | legistorm = 393/Rep_Grace_Napolitano_CA.html | followthemoney = 27347 | ontheissues = CA/Grace_Napolitano.htm | congress = grace-napolitano/1602 | worldcat = lccn-n94-55585 | cspan = 57873 | imdb = | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = gIQAW3cdKP }}\n*[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Grace_Napolitano Profile] at [[SourceWatch]]\n*[http://www.c-span.org/video/?189473-1/qa-grace-napolitano ''Q&A'' interview with Napolitano], C-SPAN, October 23, 2005]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox|state=California|district=34|before=[[Esteban Edward Torres]]|years=1999\u20132003|after=[[Lucille Roybal-Allard]]}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox|state=California|district=38|before=[[Steve Horn]]|years=2003\u20132013|after=[[Linda S\u00e1nchez]]}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox|state=California|district=32|before=[[Judy Chu]]|years=2013\u2013present|after=Incumbent}}\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Gary Miller]]<br><small>R-[[California]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=''[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]''|years=113th}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Paul Ryan]]<br><small>R-[[Wisconsin]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{CA-FedRep}}\n{{CHC Chairs}}\n{{CHC Members}}\n{{Authority control|VIAF=45992997}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n|NAME=Napolitano, Grace\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES=\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American politician\n|DATE OF BIRTH=December 4, 1936\n|PLACE OF BIRTH=[[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], [[Texas]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|DATE OF DEATH=\n|PLACE OF DEATH=\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Napolitano, Grace}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Women mayors of places in the United States]]\n[[Category:California Democrats]]\n[[Category:Female members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American members of the United States Congress]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American women in politics]]\n[[Category:Mayors of places in California]]\n[[Category:Members of the California State Assembly]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from California]]\n[[Category:People from Brownsville, Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Norwalk, California]]\n[[Category:Women state legislators in California]]\n[[Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]"}]}}}}
