In a February 2013 letter she wrote to House Speaker John Boehner, she stated:  \u201cIn addition to cuts to USF and Moffitt, the sequester will deal a harsh blow to students, teachers and our public schools. I fear for the students and families who rely on Head Start for readiness in their critical early learning years. As one of the largest school districts in the nation, Hillsborough County would face particularly steep cutbacks in terms of funding and would severely weaken its ability to provide students with the tools they need to be successful.
