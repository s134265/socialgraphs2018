This was partly due to the district\u2019s geography.  Harris is from the Baltimore suburbs, while Kratovil was from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], which is home to half the district\u2019s population. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting [[absentee ballot]]s, Kratovil\u2019s lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html|title=AP: Kratovil Winner Of 1st District Seat|publisher=WJZ-TV|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081113215948/http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html| archivedate= November 13, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapHMD/H/01|title=Maryland's 1st District |publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/| archivedate= November 7, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Harris finally conceded on November 11.

It came to light that Harris' third largest campaign donor is the pharmaceutical corporation Emergent BioSolutions, based in Rockville, Maryland. One of Emergent's products is epsil, \"a fast-acting treatment that reduces the pain associated with oral mucositis,\" which is a common complication of chemotherapy from cancer treatment. Marijuana has been recognized formally in a number of states as having immense therapeutic potential for cancer patients. In fact, in states where medical marijuana has legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly. The congressman has not explicitly addressed this issue, but  it is now clear Harris has not disclosed an important conflict of interest surrounding his recent activity against marijuana reform.<ref>http://www.attn.com/stories/463/one-congressman-just-ruined-legalized-marijuana-dc-everyone-heres-why</ref>\n\n==Committee assignments==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]]'''\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation|Subcommittee on Coast Guard & Maritime Transportation]]\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Highways and Transit|Subcommittee on highways and transit]]\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment|Subcommittee on water resources & Environment]]\n{{col-break}}\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|Committee on Natural Resources]]'''\n**[[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs|Subcommittee on fisheries, wildlife, oceans, and insular affairs]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]]'''\n**[[United States House Science Subcommittee on Research and Science Education|Subcommittee on research and science education]]\n**[[United States House Science Subcommittee on Energy|Subcommittee on energy and environment]] (chairman)\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Congressional Caucuses ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Boating\n* Chesapeake Bay Caucus\n* Coal\n* General Aviation\n{{col-break}}\n* Hungarian American\n* GOP Doctors\n* Immigration Reform\n* Marcellus Shale\n* Natural Gas\n{{col-break}}\n* Northeast Agriculture\n* Republican Israel Caucus\n* Republican Study\n* Sportsmen\u2019s\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Electoral history==\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 88%\"\n!
