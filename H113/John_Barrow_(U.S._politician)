The district includes much of the Georgia side of the [[Central Savannah River Area]] and includes counties as far south as [[Coffee County, Georgia|Coffee County]] and as far west as [[Laurens County, Georgia|Laurens County]]. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He lost his bid for re-election in 2014.\n\nAs a Democratic congressman in an increasingly Republican state, Barrow was targeted for defeat by Republican strategists from the time he  was first elected. Twice the GOP-controlled Georgia General Assembly redrew his district, forcing him to move first from Athens to Savannah and then from Savannah to Augusta to remain a resident of his district.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Galloway|first1=Jim|date=November 5, 2014|title=After years of trying, Republicans finally nail John Barrow|url=http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/11/05/after-years-of-trying-republicans-finally-nail-john-barrow/|newspaper=Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Education, early career, and family==\nBarrow was born in [[Athens, Georgia]], to Judge James Barrow and his wife, Phyllis (Jenkins) Barrow, who both had served as military officers during [[World War II]].<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/barrow.htm 1. John Barrow] ''RootsWeb''</ref> His family has deep roots in the Athens area, and according to his staff he is a great-great-nephew of [[David Crenshaw Barrow Jr.]], for whom nearby [[Barrow County, Georgia|Barrow County]] was named. Through his Barrow ancestors he is related to 19th-century Georgia Gov. Wilson Lumpkin.\n\nBarrow graduated from the [[University of Georgia]] with a political science degree in 1976. While a student, he was a member of the University's [[Demosthenian Literary Society]]. In 1979, he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]]. After graduation, he entered private practice as a [[lawyer]], working until his election to public office. Barrow divorced his wife Victoria in 2005. He has two children.\n\n==Athens-Clarke County politics==\nIn 1990, voters from the City of Athens and Clarke County voted to consolidate the two governing bodies. Barrow was elected to the newly created Athens-Clarke County Commission, representing the county's fourth district. He won re-election in 1992, 1996, and in 2000, turning away a spirited challenge from young newcomer Michael Le Houllier.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n===Legislation===\nBarrow has sponsored 59 bills of his own, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Barrow's Legislation|url=http://www.congress.gov/member/john-barrow/1780?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====109th Congress (2005-2006)====\n* H.R. 2073, a bill to create a tax credit for businesses with no more than 50 employees equal to 50% of the amount paid by the employer for health insurance coverage for the business's employees, introduced May 4, 2005.

Child care centers would be required to receive a signature from at least one of the child's parents verifying that he or she has received the notice, and would be required to maintain records of these signatures while the child is receiving care and for one year thereafter.

The 12th had been one of the districts Georgia gained as a result of the [[2000 United States Census]], and stretched from Athens to [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].  The district, with its 40% [[African-American]] population, had supposedly been drawn for a Democrat.  However, [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] college professor [[Max Burns]] had won the seat in 2002 because of ethical questions surrounding the Democratic nominee, Charles \"Champ\" Walker, Jr. Barrow won a four-way primary and went on to defeat Burns by 52% to 48%.\n\n===2006===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2006#District 12}}\nAt the same time Barrow was elected, the Republicans won control of both houses of the Georgia state legislature for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  One of their first acts was a rare mid-decade redistricting that targeted Barrow and the other white Democrat in the Georgia delegation, [[Jim Marshall (U.S. politician)|Jim Marshall]].  One proposed map, seriously considered, would have drawn his home in Athens into the heavily Republican 9th District of seven-term incumbent [[Nathan Deal]], while throwing the other half of Athens into the equally Republican 10th District of six-term incumbent [[Charlie Norwood]].\n\nThe final plan was somewhat less ambitious, but shifted all of Athens to the 10th District.  Rather than face certain defeat, Barrow moved from his ancestral home of Athens to [[Savannah]] in the newly redrawn 12th.  The new 12th was slightly less Democratic than its predecessor.  It now included several Republican-leaning Savannah suburbs that had previously been in the heavily Republican 1st District.  Barrow faced Burns in the general election and won by only 864 votes \u2014 the narrowest margin of any Democratic incumbent nationwide.  However, he trounced Burns in [[Chatham County, Georgia|Chatham]] and [[Richmond County, Georgia|Richmond]] counties \u2014 home to Democratic-leaning Savannah and Augusta, respectively (as well as more than half the district's population) \u2014 by a total of over 17,000 votes.\n\nBarrow's 2006 candidacy faced not only the mid-decade redistricting but also two visits by President [[George W. Bush]] to the district, campaigning by national figures on behalf of Burns (including RNC Chair [[Ken Mehlman]] and U.S. Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]]) and popular Governor [[Sonny Perdue]]'s reelection bid.\n\n===2008===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2008#District 12}}\nIn the 2008 election, Barrow faced a primary challenge from State Senator [[Regina Thomas]], who represents a majority-black district in Savannah.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Reid |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/politics_nation/2008/07/georgia_on_voters_minds.html |title=Georgia On Voters' Minds |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=July 15, 2008 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Barrow won the Democratic nomination with 76% of the vote over Thomas with 24% of the vote, 96% of the precincts reporting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtoctv.com/Global/link.asp?L=328706 |title=2008 Georgia primary election results |publisher=WTOC |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> He easily defeated his Republican challenger, former congressional aide John Stone, with 66% percent of the vote.<ref>[http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/states/georgia.html Georgia: Election Results 2008] The New York Times, December 9, 2008</ref>\n\n====Support for Obama====\nBarrow aligned himself closely with Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential primary. He endorsed Obama months before he won enough delegates to clinch the nomination. Obama reciprocated by recording a sixty-second radio advertisement for Barrow, who was in a contested primary. Obama said, \"We\u2019re going to need John Barrow back in Congress to help change Washington and get our country back on track.\" It was the first time Obama got involved with a Georgia election. Barrow later touted his supported from Obama in a direct-mail piece that said he works \"hand-in-hand\" with Obama.<ref name=\"Obama\">{{cite news |last= Editorial Staff |date=1 November 2010 |title=The two faces of John Barrow: Congressman peddling different messages to unsuspecting voters |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/opinion/editorials/2010-11-01/two-faces-john-barrow |newspaper=August Chronicle |location=Augusta, Georgia}}</ref>\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2010#District 12}}\nBarrow won re-election defeating Republican nominee Ray McKinney 57%-43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488764 |title=GA - District 12 Race - Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====''Augusta Chronicle'' editorial====\nIn a 2010 editorial, the ''[[Augusta Chronicle]]'' called John Barrow \"perhaps the most shameless, duplicitous, self-serving politician of his era.\"  The editorial was written after it was discovered that he sent two diametrically opposed mailers to voters in his district  - one saying he works \"hand in hand\" with President Obama, and another saying he \"stood up\" to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In closing, the editorial stated: \"That Mr. Barrow is two-faced has been revealed by his own hand. Why voters would reward that kind of disingenuous condescension is beyond us.\" <ref name=\"Obama\"/>\n\n===2012===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2012#District 12}}\nFollowing the 2010 census, the Republican-controlled state legislature significantly altered the 12th.  It lost its share of Savannah, while gaining all of Augusta and most of its suburbs.  The new district leaned Republican on paper; had it existed in 2008, [[John McCain]] would have carried it with 58 percent of the vote.  By comparison, [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 12th with 54 percent of the vote.  Since Barrow's home in Savannah was drawn into [[Jack Kingston]]'s [[Georgia's 1st congressional district|1st district]], he moved to Augusta in the reconfigured 12th and sought election there.\n\nIn April 2011, the ''National Journal'' named Barrow one of the ten most endangered Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wasserman|first=David|title=Top 10 Most Endangered Democrats|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-most-endangered-democrats-20110420|publisher=National Journal|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref>  However, in the general election, Barrow managed to defeat Republican [[Georgia House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Lee Anderson (politician)|Lee Anderson]] 54%-46%, even as [[Mitt Romney]] easily carried the district.  According to an editorial in the ''[[Augusta Chronicle]]'', this was mainly because Anderson was almost invisible during the campaign; notably, he never debated Barrow.<ref>[http://chronicle.augusta.com/opinion/editorials/2012-11-08/bottom-line-lee-andersons-campaign Bottom Line: Lee Anderson's campaign (Editorial)] Augusta Chronicle, November 8, 2012</ref>\n\n===2014===\nIn the 2014 Democratic primaries, Barrow went unopposed.
