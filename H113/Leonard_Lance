Retrieved June 4, 2008.</ref> The primary left his campaign's funds depleted, leading him to hold several fundraisers, including one with President [[George W. Bush]]. Touring his district, he ran on a platform of fiscal conservatism, moderate social values, and environmentalism.  He vowed to be \"an independent voice\" in Congress if elected.\n\nHis Democratic opponent was [[Linda Stender]], a New Jersey Assemblywoman who unsuccessfully challenged Republican incumbent Ferguson in 2006. During the campaign, Lance took strong positions against the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]], the [[estate tax]], Governor [[Jon Corzine]]'s controversial [[Jon Corzine#Toll hike plan and protest|toll hike plan]], and the partisan nature of the United States Congress. He came under fire from Stender's campaign for his 2006 vote in the New Jersey Senate against a bill which prevented pharmacists from refusing to dispense medication such as birth control pills due to religious concerns. Lance was one of only a few Senators to vote against the bill. However, both Lance and Stender are [[pro-choice]]. Lance was firmly opposed to negotiations with Iran on the presidential level, saying that he only favors holding such talks on a ministerial level.  He also made energy independence one of his signature issues, along with fiscal accountability and debt reduction.  On foreign policy, both candidates supported withdrawal from [[Iraq]], a two-state solution in the [[Israel]]-[[Palestine]] conflict, and increased attention to the genocide in [[Darfur]]. Lance and Stender debated each other twice during the campaign.  In September, they met in [[Scotch Plains, New Jersey|Scotch Plains]] for a debate hosted at the Jewish Community Campus of Central New Jersey. It was moderated by [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield]] Rabbi Douglas Sagal.  The candidates met in October in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]] for a second debate, which was televised on [[News 12 New Jersey]] and moderated by Walt Kane.  On October 21, ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' editorial board endorsed Lance in the 2008 election. On October 25, ''[[The New York Times]]'' followed suit. Eight other newspapers also endorsed Lance over Stender.\n\nOn Election Day, November 4, 2008, Lance defeated Linda Stender 50%-42%.<ref>Bricketto, Martin C.
