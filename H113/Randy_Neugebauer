The seat came open after 18-year Republican incumbent [[Larry Combest]] announced his retirement not long after having been reelected to a 10th term in 2002.  The 19th is one of the most conservative areas of Texas (indeed, in the entire nation), and it was taken for granted that Combest would be succeeded by another Republican, though at the time Combest had been the only Republican to have represented the 19th District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://house.gov/?sectionid=2&sectiontree=2 |title=Congressman Randy Neugebauer : Home |publisher=Randy.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>\n\nNeugebauer finished first in the crowded seven-way, all-Republican field.  However, as he finished well short of a majority, he forced into a second round of balloting with fellow Republican [[Mike Conaway]] of [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], the chairman of the Texas Board of Public Accountancy and a friend of President [[George W. Bush]]. In a close third-place finish in the first round of balloting was then-[[Texas House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Carl Isett]] of Lubbock.  In the runoff election, Neugebauer defeated Conaway by only 587 votes, becoming only the fourth person to represent the 19th since its creation in 1935. Soon afterward in 2004, Conaway won election to Congress in the newly reconfigured [[Texas' 11th congressional district]].\n\nNeugebauer ran for a full term in 2004, facing 26-year incumbent Democrat [[Charles Stenholm]] of Abilene.  Stenholm had previously represented the Abilene-based [[Texas' 17th congressional district]], but that district had been dismantled in the [[2003 Texas redistricting]].  The largest chunk of Stenholm's former territory was thrown into Neugebauer's district. Although Stenholm had more seniority, the new district retained about 60 percent of Neugebauer's former territory.  Neugebauer won by 18 points, and has been reelected four more times with little substantive opposition.\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2010#District 19}}\nIn the 2010 [[Texas House of Representatives]] election, Neugebauer supported the election of the conservative [[Jim Landtroop]] to the District 85 seat.
