He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the senior member of the Alabama U.S. House delegation.  The district includes  most of the wealthier portions of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], along with most of that city's suburbs.  A member of the Republican Party, he served as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee (2011-2013) and currently holds the title of Chairman Emeritus on the committee.

Because new legislative elections were scheduled for 1983, he served only one year.  In 1983 he was elected to the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]. In 1986, he was elected as the first Republican to the Alabama State Board of Education, serving one four-year term representing the 6th District.  In 1990, he ran unsuccessfully for Attorney General of Alabama.  In 1991, he became Chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, serving in that position until his campaign for Congress.\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n===Summary===\nBachus was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992 with 59 percent of the vote. He has been re-elected ever since by wide margins. From 2006 to 2012, Bachus was the leading Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, serving as committee chairman when his party held a House majority during the 112th Congress. Due to House Republican term limits on committee leadership positions, Bachus was named Chairman Emeritus of the Financial Services Committee and rejoined the Judiciary Committee, which he had to take leave of when named Financial Services Chair.\n\nOn September 30, 2013, Bachus announced his retirement from Congress. His current term ends in January 2015.\n\n===Elections===\nThe 6th District and its predecessors had been based in Birmingham for over a century, but after the [[1990 United States Census]], the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] required the state to have a black-majority district. The state legislature failed to act, and a federal court drafted a plan that significantly reconfigured both the 6th District and the neighboring 7th District.  The new map shifted most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham (which is over 60 percent black) to the 7th, which had been based in Tuscaloosa for over a century.\n\nIn the process, however, the court plan shifted most of the whiter and wealthier portions of Tuscaloosa to the 6th.  Also added was [[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby County]], a wealthy suburban county near Birmingham.  The new 6th was almost 97 percent white, and on paper was one of the most Republican districts in the nation.  Bachus immediately jumped into the race.  Despite being state party chairman, he only won 39 percent of the vote in the five-candidate primary and was forced into a runoff with party activist Marty Connors.  In the runoff, however, Bachus won handily with 59 percent of the vote.\n\nBachus then moved to the general election against five-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Ben Erdreich]].  Although Erdreich outspent Bachus by more than 2 to 1, he could not overcome the new district's heavy Republican tilt, as well as the fact that he was running in territory he did not know and that did not know him.  Ultimately, Bachus defeated Erdreich by seven points.  [[George H. W. Bush]] carried the new 6th with a staggering 71 percent of the vote, proving just how Republican this reconfigured district was.  However, conservative Democrats continued to hold many local offices well into the 1990s.\n\nSince 1992, Bachus has been re-elected nine times without anything resembling serious opposition.  After defeating three underfunded Democrats with 70 percent or more of the vote, he did not face Democratic opposition at all from 2000 to 2010.  [[John McCain]] carried the district in 2008 with 77 percent of the vote, his highest percentage in the nation.\n\n;2004\nBachus was challenged in the 2004 Republican primary by [[Phillip Jauregui]], a member of former Alabama Chief Justice [[Roy Moore]]'s legal team. Since no other party ran a candidate, victory in the Republican primary was [[tantamount to election]] in November. Jauregui claimed that Bachus wasn't doing enough to curb \"[[judicial activism]].\" However, Bachus won the primary easily, effectively clinching a seventh term.\n\n;2010\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2010|2010 midterm elections]] Bachus easily turned back a challenge from [[tea party protests|tea party]] activist Stan Cooke in the Republican primary, winning 75% of the vote.  For the fourth election in a row, no other party even put up a candidate, assuring Bachus of a 10th term.\n\n;2012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2012#District 6}}\nBachus decided to run for re-election after redistricting to the newly redrawn 6th district.  In the Republican primary, he drew three challengers, most notably State Senator [[Scott Beason]].  Beason ran well to Bachus's right and called for  \"true conservative leadership.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/sweethome/2012/03/us_rep_spencer_bachus_turns_ba.html|title=U.S. Rep.

He is a signer of [[Americans for Tax Reform#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]\u2019s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].<ref name =\"ATR\">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBachus has been an active legislator, engaging in many important issues over the course of his Congressional career.  He helped amend the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] to curtail identity theft and ease consumer access to their credit reports. Bachus also has a reputation for good constituent service.\n\n;1990's\n\nIn the late 1990's, during his tenure as Chairman of the Banking Oversight Committee, he uncovered the [[Community Development Financial Institute]] (CDFI), which led to the resignation of the top two CDFI officials.\n\nIn the 1990s he became an advocate of international debt relief for the Third World, and joined a broad coalition of activists in a one-day fast to demand action, which was ultimately successful. He criticized the Bush administration over negotiations with the genocidal regime in Sudan, and urged Bush to stop payment of oil revenues to the Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite news |title= Bachus' plan could force Sudan to stop humanitarian crisis |publisher=Tuscaloosa News|date=July 13, 2004 |url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20040713/NEWS/407130304#gsc.tab=}}</ref> Bachus was credited when the Bush Administration decided, in 2007, to place sanctions on Sudan.<ref>{{cite news |title= Bush finally comes around to Bachus view |publisher=Tuscaloosa News|date=June 2, 2007 |url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070603/NEWS/706030344&Title=TOMMY-STEVENSON-Bush-finally-comes-around-to-Bachus-view}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Bachus pushed for the creation of the [[Alabama National Cemetery]], a [[United States National Cemetery]] located in [[Montevallo, Alabama]].  Bachus said,  \u201cThe Alabama National Cemetery will always be the thing I\u2019m most proud of...It was the second one built, and I\u2019m so thankful for it.

With the passage of the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, commercial banks, investment banks, securities firms, and insurance companies were allowed to consolidate. The legislation was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n;2000s\n\nWhile Bachus was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit (2001 \u2013 2006), the House of Representatives passed and the President signed into law the [[The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003]] (P.L. 108-159), which contained the strongest federal identity theft protections enacted into law to that date and entitled consumers to annual free credit reports from each of three major credit bureaus.\n\nAdditionally, while Bachus was Subcommittee Chairman, enacted into law was [[Check 21 Act|The Check Clearing for the 21st Century (CHECK) Act of 2003]] (P.L. 108-100).  This law authorized the use of digital versions of paper checks for transfer by financial institutions, saving money and eliminating delays and losses caused by the transportation of physical checks.\n\nAgain, as Subcommittee Chairman, Bachus played a leading role in passing the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act|The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005]] (P.L. 109-173), which reformed the federal deposit insurance system and raised the FDIC coverage limit for retirement accounts to $250,000.\n\nOn June 29, 2005 he voted for the increase of funds by another $25 million for anti-marijuana print and TV ads.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vote Count H.R. 3058|work= Washington Post |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/109/house/1/votes/336/}}</ref>\n\nOn Jul 26, 2002 he voted for the Homeland Security Act of 2002 which created the Department of Homeland Security.<ref>{{cite web |title=H.R. 5005 Homeland Security Act of 2002 (On Passage of the Bill)|work= Gov Track|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/107/hr5005}}</ref>\n\nOn December 14, 2005 he voted for the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act.  The USA PATRIOT Act is an Act of Congress that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001. The title of the act is a ten-letteracronym (USA PATRIOT) that stands for Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001.[1] On May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011.\n\nBachus is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online [[poker]].

According to the book [http://www.randomhouse.com/book/212139/act-of-congress-by-robert-g-kaiser Act of Congress] by Robert Kaiser, \u201cBachus thought that if it had passed in 2005, subprime lending would have dried up, and the Great Crash could have been avoided or at least made much less serious.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert|title=Act of Congress|date=January 28, 2014|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-307-74451-7|page=122|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/212139/act-of-congress-by-robert-g-kaiser}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Bachus proposed the [http://www.ffiec.gov/safeact.htm Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing], an addition to the [[Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008]] that required licensing for mortgage brokers.\n\nIn 2010, Bachus stated that \u201cending the bailout of Fannie [Mae] and Freddie [Mac]\u201d was his top priority as Chairman of the Financial Services Committee.  He said that \u201cusing taxpayer money to subsidize the mortgage market is an addiction\u201d and that \u201cHouse Republicans want to reform the housing finance system in a way that does not rely on government guarantees, that does not make private investors and creditors wealthy while saddling taxpayers with losses, and that does not set the stage for the next financial crisis.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |title=Bachus: Ending the Bail Out of Fannie and Freddie|work= CNBC|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/40012075}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the FBI and American Football Coaches Association honored Bachus for his advocacy and support for the National Child Identification Prorgram.
