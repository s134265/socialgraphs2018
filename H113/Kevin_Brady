He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district includes a large swath of suburban and rural territory north of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].\n\n==Early life, education, and early political career==\nBrady was born in [[Vermillion, South Dakota]], one of five children of William F. and Nancy A. Brady. His father, a lawyer, was killed in 1967 in a courtroom shooting in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] when Brady was 12 years old. His mother was left to raise five children by herself. Student body president and a four-sport athlete, Brady graduated from Rapid City Central High School in 1973. Working his way through college holding a variety of jobs\u2014construction worker, meat packer, manufacturing worker, waiter, and bartender\u2014Brady earned a degree in mass communications from the [[University of South Dakota]] in Vermillion,<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/22038/</ref> where he played varsity baseball, served in the student government association and became a member of the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] Fraternity. In 2005 he was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the university, and in 2001 was a recipient of the Order of Achievement by the national Lambda Chi Alpha organization.\n\nA chamber of commerce executive at the Rapid City Area Chamber of Commerce, Brady was elected to the Rapid City Common Council at age 26. In 1982 he moved to Texas to work for the Beaumont Chamber of Commerce and later the South Montgomery County Woodlands Chamber of Commerce.\n\n==Texas House of Representatives==\nBrady began his Texas political career in 1990 when he was elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]], representing The Woodlands, parts of Montgomery County, and five other counties west and north of Houston.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n;1996\nIncumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[Jack Fields]] of [[Texas' 8th congressional district]] decided to retire. Brady decided to run and ranked second in the Republican primary with 22% of the vote in a six candidate field. But the candidate who ranked first, Dr. Gene Fontenot, received just 36% of the vote, short of the 50% threshold.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222672</ref> In the run-off election, Brady defeated him 53%\u201347%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222682</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in [[Bush v. Vera]] that three congressional districts in Texas were unconstitutional.<ref>http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-03-09/texas-redistricting-a-timeline/</ref> After holding hearings, the court concluded that there was no longer time to hold primaries and instead forced all candidates (Democrats and Republicans) be listed together on the November general election ballot in a [[jungle primary]]. If no candidate reached 50%, a special runoff would be held on December 10 between the two highest ranking candidates regardless of political party. In the November election, Brady ranked first with 41% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30056</ref> In the December run-off election, he defeated Fontenot again 59%\u201341%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30083</ref>\n\n;1998\u20132008\nDuring this time period, he never won re-election with less than 67% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1744</ref>\n\n;2010\u20132012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2010#District 8}}\nFor the first time since 1998, Brady was challenged in the Republican primary. Three candidates filed against him. He defeated all of them in the March primary with 79% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=612091</ref> He won re-election with 80% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=524824</ref> In the May 2012, Republican primary in a newly-redrawn district he defeated his challenger with 76% of the vote. In the November 6, 2012 general election he defeated his Democratic opponent with over 77% of the vote.\n\n;2014\n\nIn the Republican primary on March 4, Brady easily won re-nomination to a tenth term in the U.S. House. He polled 41,549 votes (68 percent) to 19,508 (32 percent) for his intraparty challenger, Craig McMichael.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the General election held November 4, 2014 Brady was easily re-elected to his seat in the U.S. House. He polled 124,897 votes (89.32 percent) to 14,930 (10.67 percent) for his challenger, Ken Petty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/nov04_175_state.htm?x=0&y=2480&id=565|title=2014 General election returns|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nBrady has been a reliable [[American conservatism|conservative]] and serves as a Deputy Whip for the House majority. He has advocated lower taxes, deficit reduction and [[free trade]], and called for replacing the [[income tax (U.S.)|income tax]] with a [[national sales tax]].\n\nAs a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee he has chaired the Trade Sub-Committee and, beginning this year, became chairman of the Health Sub-Committee which places him in the center of congressional debate on Medicare and President Obama's new health care law. He was also recently tapped to lead the Energy Working Group as the committee pursues comprehensive tax reform in 2013.\n\nIn 2002, Rep. Brady voted in favor of the authorization of force against the nation of Iraq.\n\nIn 2004 he led the successful effort to restore the sales tax deduction, which had been eliminated in 1986. Brady has been a leader on free trade within Congress, serving as President George W. Bush's point man on the successful passage of the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central America Free Trade Agreement]] and the recent agreements with S.Korea, Colombia and Panama. However, he is best known as the author of a federal \"[[sunset clause|sunset law]]\" that would require every federal program not specifically written into the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] to justify its existence to taxpayers within 12 years or face elimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/directory/kevin-brady/ |title=U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady |publisher=The Texas Tribune |date=November 4, 1955 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> He has introduced this bill at the beginning of every Congress. It was approved overwhelmingly by the House as an amendment in 2004 but did not progress further. In 2006 it passed the Government Reform Committee but did not reach a floor vote.\n\nBrady is the Chairman of the U.S. House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, the third Texan to lead the committee (Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and Rep. Wright Patman). Brady and his staff developed the \"Organizational Chart of the House Democrats Health Plan\", the complex chart that showed the creation of at least 31 new federal agencies, commissions and mandates included in the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009]]. He has also called on Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] to step down, citing rising unemployment, exaggerated stimulus job claims, unsustainable debt and \"failed economic policies\" of the Obama administration.\n\nRecently he has introduced three major pieces of legislation: The MAP Act which shrinks the size of the federal government, abolishes obsolete agencies, establishes a line item-veto for each President and permanently ends the threat of a future government shutdown; the Sound Dollar Act which reforms the Federal Reserve(see below)and most recently the Centennial Monetary Commission which creates a bi-partisan commission to examine the Federal Reserve Bank's effectiveness and role over the first 100 years of existence and make Legislative recommendations for its second century of existence.\n  \nIn March 2012, he proposed the ''Sound Dollar Act'', which ii require the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] to [[Gold standard|monitor gold]] and the [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange value]] of the [[U.S. Dollar]]. The bill would also replace the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate of controlling unemployment and inflation with one mandate for U.S. Dollar [[price stability]].<ref>http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/293730/king-dollar-will-cut-oil-prices-larry-kudlow</ref>\n\nBrady's district was hit hard by [[Hurricane Rita]] and again by [[Hurricane Ike]], and he has helped lead the Texas recovery effort in the House for both disasters. Recently{{when|date=September 2013}}, in the interim redistricting map approved by a San Antonio federal court the 8th District lost seven counties in east and southeast Texas and gained all or part of six counties going north toward Dallas.\n\n===Legislation===\nOn April 9, 2014, Brady introduced the [[American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress)]] into the House.<ref name=4438sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4438 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4438|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> The bill would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to modify the calculation method and the rate for the [[Research & Experimentation Tax Credit|tax credit for qualified research expenses]] that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent.<ref name=4438cbo>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4438|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45324|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> The bill was supported by organizations such as the [[National Taxpayers Union]] and [[Americans for Tax Reform]], but was opposed by the [[Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] because it did not pay for the credits with any offsets.<ref name=WHveto6>{{cite web|title=Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 4438|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr4438r_20140506.pdf|publisher=Executive Office of the President|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=6 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=NTUyes7>{{cite web|last=Swift|first=Nan|title=\u201cYES\u201d on H.R. 4438, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014|url=http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/yes-on-hr-4438-05_07_2014.html|publisher=National Taxpayers Union|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=7 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=ATRmay5>{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Ryan|title=ATR Supports H.R. 4438, Permanent Research and Development Tax Cut|url=http://www.atr.org/atr-supports-hr-4438-permanent-research-and-development-tax-cut|publisher=American for Tax Reform|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]]'''\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]] (Chairman)\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade|Subcommittee on Trade]]\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security|Subcommittee on Social Security]]\n*'''[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]]''' (Chairman)\n\n===Caucus memberships===\n*Army Caucus\n*Congressional Missing and Exploited Children Caucus\n*Congressional Rural Caucus\n*[[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]]\n*Sportsmen's Caucus\n\n==Personal life==\nBrady lives in [[The Woodlands, Texas|The Woodlands]], a [[suburb]] of Houston with his wife Cathy and two young sons (Will and and Sean).<ref>{{cite web|title=About Kevin Brady|url=http://kevinbrady.house.gov/about/}}</ref> He is an original Hometown Hero of The Woodlands awarded by Interfaith-of-The Woodlands, a Paul Harris Fellow in The Woodlands Rotary Club and a member of Saints Simon & Jude Catholic Church.

He was returning from a reception with his mother, wife, sister, and brother-in-law in the car when it was pulled over for a non-working tail light. He faced a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail. He pleaded [[no contest]]. Upon his misdemeanor conviction on November 8, he was fined $350, and his right to drive in South Dakota was suspended for 30 days. Before his sentencing, Brady had stated that \"no one is above the law\" and he would accept \"every consequence\" of his actions, even if that meant a jail sentence. \"To me, regardless of how this turns out, what it says is that you don't get behind the wheel.\" <ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-10-11-drunk-congressman_x.htm Texas Congressman Kevin Brady charged with DUI]</ref>\n\n==References==\n<div class=\"references-small\">\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n</div>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.house.gov/brady/ Congressman Kevin Brady] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.bradyforcongress.com Kevin Brady for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Texas/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Kevin_Brady_%5BR-8%5D}}\n*{{CongLinks | congbio = b000755 | ballot = Kevin_Brady | nndb = 396/000032300 | votesmart = 361 | govtrack = 400046 | opencong = 400046 | rollcall = 465 | politifact = kevin-brady | fec = H6TX08100 | opensecrets = N00005883 | assets = kevin-brady | legistorm = 145/Rep_Kevin_Brady_TX.html | followthemoney = | ontheissues = TX/Kevin_Brady.htm | congress = kevin-brady/1468 | worldcat = | cspan = 45749 | imdb = | bloomberg = kevin-brady | nyt = | wsj = | washpo = gIQATjbPAP }}\n*[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Kevin_Brady Profile] at [[SourceWatch]]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-tx-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=Mike McKinney}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]]<br>from the 15th district|years=1991\u20131997}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Tommy Williams (politician)|Tommy Williams]]}}\n|-\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Jack Fields]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[List of United States Representatives from Texas|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[Texas's 8th congressional district]]|years=1997\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Bob Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Chairperson of the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]]|years=2013\u20132015}}\n{{s-aft|after=TBD}}\n|-\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Robert Aderholt]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]|years=86th}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Danny K.
