She was chair of the Contracts Committee and was also co-chair of the Council's Women's Caucus.

This finding forced New York City to end its system of economic discrimination.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} As co-chair of the New York Council's Women's Caucus, Clarke secured $9.5 million in funding for organizations that addressed the issues of domestic violence prevention, breast cancer awareness, housing and HIV/AIDS counseling for women.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nShe cosponsored City Council resolutions that opposed the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], criticized the federal [[USA PATRIOT Act]], and called for a national moratorium on the [[death penalty]]. She was a frequent critic of the [[George W.
