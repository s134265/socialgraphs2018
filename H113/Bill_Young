However, it has become much friendlier to [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] candidates in recent years, at least on the national level. Since 1988, it has supported a Republican for president only once, in 2004. Despite the Democratic trend in his district at the national level, Young usually skated to reelection.

Even though the divorce records were sealed, many journalists at the time \"knew about the affair and the [extramarital child's] birth, but believed such issues fell outside the public's right to know.\"  Terry, Pamela and Kimber also claimed that they had only heard from their father sporadically in the three decades following the divorce.<ref name=firstfam/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[C.
