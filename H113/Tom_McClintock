McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election because the [[California Constitution]] required him to maintain his legal residence in his State Senate district until the end of his Senate term.

McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]], in his State Senate district.
