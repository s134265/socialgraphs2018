So far the House Judiciary Committee has passed four immigration related bills:<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/markups113.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n* H.R. 2278, the \"Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement Act\" (The SAFE Act)<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06182013.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n* H.R. 1773, the \"Agricultural Guestworker Act\"<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06192013.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n* H.R. 1772, the \"Legal Workforce Act\"<ref name=\"judiciary.house.gov\">[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06262013.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n* H.R. 2131, the \"SKILLS Visa Act\"<ref name=\"judiciary.house.gov\"/>\n\n====Balanced Budget Amendment====\nOne of Representative Goodlatte's top legislative initiatives was his Constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget. Goodlatte wrote and put forward both the \"clean\" Balanced Budget Amendment which had a higher chance of actually passing the House and the Senate as well as a version that makes it harder to increase taxes by requiring a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to raise taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.org/conservatives-congress-vote-weak-balanced-budget-a6580|title=Conservatives to Congress: Vote NO on a Weak Balanced Budget Amendment|author=Mattie Duppler|date=2011-11-09|accessdate=2012-06-03|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/192699-gop-favors-clean-balanced-budget-amendment-sponsor-says |title=Sponsor says 'clean' balanced budget amendment has edge for floor vote |publisher=TheHill |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> However, Representatives [[Paul Ryan]], [[Justin Amash]], [[David Dreier]] and [[Louie Gohmert]] voted against the \"clean\" amendment because it could have allowed taxes to be raised on Americans. Representative Ryan released a statement after the vote: [http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/why-ryan-voted-against-balanced-budget-amendment \"I\u2019m concerned that this version will lead to a much bigger government fueled by more taxes. Spending is the problem, yet this version of the Balanced Budget Amendment makes it more likely taxes will be raised, government will grow, and economic freedom will be diminished. Without a limit on government spending, I cannot support this Amendment.\u201d]\n\nBob Goodlatte voted to increase the U.S. debt ceiling seven times and has voted to pass budgets from Democratic as well as Republican administrations.
