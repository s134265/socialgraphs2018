The district had been one of the first areas of Georgia where the old-line conservative Democrats had begun splitting their tickets and voting Republican at the national level.  While conservative Democrats represented much of this area in the state legislature well into the 1990s, the district has only supported a Democrat for president once since 1960, when [[Jimmy Carter]] swept every county in the state during his successful run for president in 1976.\n\nKingston easily won the election with 58 percent of the vote, becoming the first Republican to represent this district since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  Kingston was likely helped by the 1990s round of redistricting, which significantly altered the district.  The 1st had been based in Savannah for over a century, but redistricting shifted most of Savannah's black residents to the newly created [[Georgia's 11th congressional district|11th District]].  Kingston was reelected 10 times, never facing a serious challenger.  Since his initial run for the seat, he has never received less than 63 percent of the vote.  Even when the district included all of Savannah (most of it was added back to the district from 1996 to 2002, and was restored again after the 2010s round of redistricting), Kingston was reelected handily, even running unopposed in 1998.  He was also reelected unopposed in 2004.\n\n===Tenure===\nFrom 2003 through the end of 2006, Kingston served as [[Republican Conference Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|vice-chairman]] of the [[House Republican Conference]], the sixth-ranking post among House Republicans. An early attempt to become chair of the influential [[House Appropriations Committee]] in the [[112th Congress]] (2011\u20132013) was unsuccessful.  Kingston was an early supporter of earmark reforms and spending reductions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46077.html |title=Tea party favorite may not get chair - Simmi Aujla |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Throughout his tenure, Kingston has received over 40 awards on a diversity of issues from various interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Jack Kingston - Awards|url=http://www.kingston.house.gov/aboutjack/awards.htm}}</ref>\n\n;Taxes\nKingston has signed the [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]] by the [[Americans for Tax Reform]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atr.org/taxpayer-protection-pledge |title= List of Pledge Signers in the 113th Congress |accessdate=2013-12-02}}</ref> and in 2009 he was named a \"Taxpayer Hero\" by the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste for his votes to reduce government spending and taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccagw.org/media/press-releases/taxpayer-watchdog-group-names-rep-jack-kingston-%E2%80%9Ctaxpayer-hero%E2%80%9D |title= Taxpayer Watchdog Group Names Rep.
