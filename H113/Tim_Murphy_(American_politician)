The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat [[Frank Mascara]]. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent [[John Murtha]]. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods\u2014and even streets\u2014were split between districts.  In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania|Charleroi]] was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.\n\nMurphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%-40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1322|title=Our Campaigns - PA District 18 Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n;2004\nMurphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%-37%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4332|title=Our Campaigns - PA - District 18 Race - Nov 02, 2004|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n;2006\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006#District 18}}\nIn 2006, Murphy was confronted by [[KDKA-TV|KDKA News]] reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwh-OCFCOTc |title=Congressman Tim Murphy R-PA on KDKA News taking the evidence |publisher=YouTube |date=November 2, 2006 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> Murphy was challenged by Democrat [[Chad Kluko]], a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election.
