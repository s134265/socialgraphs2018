The only other Democrat to represent this district, [[Bill Gunter]], left to run for the [[United States Senate]] in 1974 after only one term.\n\nGrayson is considered a [[progressivism|progressive]] Democrat. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in 2008. He was a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], of which he was vice-chairman.<ref name=\"grijalva\"/> Grayson twice joined Republicans to oppose the raising of the federal debt limit. He said, \"We need to live within our means. We need to eliminate wasteful spending. If we did those two simple things, we would not need to raise the debt limit.\"<ref name=\"grayson fights\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.RES 686, Grayson's \"Teach the Constitution Week\" bill. The bill urged high schools to spend one week each September teaching the [[United States Constitution]] to high school seniors and also encouraged students to petition the government on an issue of personal importance to them to demonstrate their understanding of their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States. The non-partisan resolution was passed by a voice vote and featured 222 co-sponsors.<ref name=\"Thomas.gov686\"/><ref name=\"The Orlando Sentinel\"/><ref name=\"house passes\"/>\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the historic [[Apollo 11]] moon landing in 1969, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Grayson's \"New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2009\". The bill asked the president to present Congress's highest civilian honor, the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], to Apollo 11 astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr.]], and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], as well as [[John Glenn]], the first American to orbit the Earth.

He lobbies colleagues personally and in July 2013, [[David Weigel]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine called him \"the most effective member of the House\" and said that he was approaching \"an unheralded title: The congressman who\u2019s passed more amendments than any of his 434 peers\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/florida_democrat_alan_grayson_is_the_most_effective_member_of_the_house.html |title=The Congressman Formerly Known as Crazy |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013 |publisher= Slate.com}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2013, his campaign sent out a fundraising email that compared the Tea Party to the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. It used the image of a burning cross as the \"T\" in Tea Party. Matt Gorman of the National Republican Congressional Committee described the e-mail as \"hateful words and imagery\". Grayson defended the comparison, saying that \"here is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation.\"<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/alan-grayson-tea-party-kkk-98673.html</ref>\n\n===Political positions===\n;Federal reserve\nDuring his first term in office, Grayson supported [[Ron Paul]]'s [[Audit the Fed]] legislation.<ref name=\"Ocala Star-Banner\"/> Grayson gained attention for exchanges with [[Federal Reserve System]] Vice Chairman [[Donald Kohn]] and [[Inspector General]] [[Elizabeth A. Coleman]].<ref name=\"salon\"/> The 5-minute examination of Coleman in the House Financial Services Committee was posted on Grayson's official YouTube page, and as of December 2010, it has been viewed more than 4 million times.<ref name=\"Youtube\"/>\n\nOn a September 2009 ''[[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones Show]]'' segment, Grayson criticized [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chair]] [[Ben Bernanke|Bernanke]]'s senior adviser Linda Robertson, saying \"Here I am the only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist, this lobbyist, this [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)#Lobbying|K-Street]] whore, is trying to teach me about economics!\"<ref name=\"problem child\"/><ref name=\"salon war room\"/> Robertson had previously worked as a lobbyist for [[Enron]].<ref name=\"Evans\" /> Grayson's language was widely criticized as inappropriate,<ref name=\"politico.com\"/> and Grayson apologized.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]], Grayson joined fellow freshman Democrat [[Jim Himes]] of [[Connecticut]] to introduce the Grayson-Himes Pay for Performance Act, legislation to require that all bonuses paid by companies that had received funds under the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] be \"based on performance\".<ref name=\"house passes1\"/> The bill was co-sponsored by eight other members of the House. On March 26, the bill was approved by the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 38\u201322 and on April 1, the bill was passed by the full House of Representatives by a vote of 247\u2013171.<ref name=\"orlandosentinel\"/>\n\nGrayson was a co-sponsor of the [[Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009]], which would provide additional provisions to audit the [[Federal Reserve]], including removing several key exemptions.<ref name=\"transparency act\"/>\n\n;Economic stimulus\nGrayson made it a priority to increase the amount of federal money returning to his district. He often said that people in his district had been \"exporting taxes and importing debt.\" During his first year in office, the amount of federal grant dollars returning to the district nearly doubled with a 98% increase.<ref name=\"USAspending.gov\"/><ref name=\"open congress\"/> Grayson established a grant notification system that notifies subscribers immediately when a federal grant opportunity in their areas of interest becomes available. He also hired a full-time grants coordinator who focused solely on helping people navigate the federal grants process.\n\nGrayson supported the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and has been outspoken in favor of extending unemployment benefits for Americans who have lost their jobs. Grayson argues that the government has never cut off unemployment insurance when the unemployment rate was higher than eight percent. Grayson also voted for [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] oversight of tobacco products, which would give the FDA power to regulate [[tobacco products|tobacco]].\n\nGrayson has worked to combat federal waste, fraud, and abuse. In the September 6, 2009 edition of ''The New York Times'', columnist Gretchen Morgenson thanked Grayson for uncovering the fact that, due to the federal bailout of mortgage finance giant [[Fannie Mae]], taxpayer money had been funding the legal defense fees for former top executives at the institution. Grayson requested information about these legal costs after a June 2009 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Grayson's work uncovered that, between September 6, 2008 and July 21, 2009, taxpayers spent $6.3 million defending Fannie Mae executives Franklin Raines, J. Timothy Howard, and Leanne Spencer. Taxpayers paid an additional $16.8 million to cover legal expenses of workers at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's former regulator.<ref name=\" The New York Times\"/>\n\nIn September 2009, Grayson used a parliamentary maneuver called an \"extension of remarks\" to provide crucial instruction on H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, a bill that, among other things, included a provision that prohibited funding for ACORN (the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]]). Grayson's extension of remarks directed that the legislation defund ''any'' organization that cheats the federal government, not just ACORN. The defunding measure passed the House with a final vote of 253\u2013171.<ref name=\"Thomas.gov3221\"/> Grayson also encouraged the public to report companies covered by the bill and set up a method to report offending companies via his Congressional website.<ref name=\" The Huffington Post\"/>\n\n;Healthcare reform\nIn response to Republican arguments that the Obama administration's preferred health care bill was too long and complicated, Grayson on March 9, 2010, introduced H.R. 4789, the [[Public Option Act]] (sometimes called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act), a short four-page bill which would allow all citizens and permanent residents of the United States to buy into the public [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program at cost.<ref name=\"po act\"/> The bill attracted 82 co-sponsors and was referred to the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nGrayson later voted for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]<ref name=\"roll call 167\"/> and the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].<ref name=\"roll call 194\"/> He voted in support of eliminating adjustments of Medicare rates of payment.  He also voted against Republican substitutes for the health care amendment and insurance law amendments.<ref name=\"key vote\"/>\n\nOn September 29, 2009 in a late-night speech on the House floor, Grayson presented his impression of the Republican's heath plan, illustrated by signs. He said the Republican health plan was \"don't get sick\", and \"if you do get sick, die quickly\".<ref>http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27726.html</ref> After demands from Republicans that he apologize, he defended his comment and in a [[Procedures of the United States House of Representatives#House floor|House Floor]] speech stated, \u201cI apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this [[holocaust]] in America.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/30/house.floor.controversy/ | work=CNN | title=Democrat stands ground after 'die quickly' health care remark | date=October 1, 2009}}</ref> He was then further lambasted for his use of the word ''holocaust'' by Jewish spokespersons across the nation. Grayson, who is Jewish, apologized to the [[Anti-defamation League]] for those offended by his generic use of ''holocaust''.<ref name=\"young turks\"/><ref name=\"unlikely\"/><ref name=\"ref112\"/> He also maintained that Congressional Republicans failed to offer a feasible plan.<ref name=cnnpoliticalticker/><ref name=cbsnews/> In October 2009 he launched [http://www.namesofthedead.com/ www.NamesOfTheDead.com], a website to \"memorialize Americans who die because they don't have health insurance.\" He subsequently read stories of the dead submitted through the Names of the Dead site on the House floor.<ref name=namesofthedead/>\n\n;Social issues\nGrayson is [[United States pro-choice movement|pro-choice]] and supports increased funding for stem cell research.<ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/FL/Alan_Grayson_Abortion.htm \"Alan Grayson on Abortion\"], ''On the Issues'', September 5, 2013</ref> He has always supported [[same-sex marriage]] and said in an interviews in 2013, \"the propaganda that somehow gay marriage makes straight marriage bad for everyone is just farcical to me.

He also voted for the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]]. Grayson supported the [[Paycheck Fairness Act]], a bill that allows victims of [[wage discrimination]] to sue for punitive damages.<ref name=\"key vote\"/>\n\n;Environment\nGrayson voted for the House's 2009 [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] (ACES). The bill would provide for a $50 million \"Hurricane Research Center\" in Central Florida, and Grayson claimed it would immediately generate new jobs.<ref name=\"hurricane center\"/> Grayson noted after the passage of the ACES Act his concern about our dependence on foreign oil, the need to promote [[green technologies]], [[renewable energy]] sources, and the job creation from the bill (an estimated 95,000 jobs in Florida). \"This bill unleashes American ingenuity to solve the energy crisis. It lets us solve our problems by being Americans and thinking our way out of it. We will become an international energy power,\" he said in a news release.\n\nThe [[BP oil spill]] in the Gulf of Mexico affected Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately. Instead, it took months to drill a new relief well, while millions of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf each week.<ref name=\"The Daily Green\"/> In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency Relief Well Act, which would require that an emergency relief well be drilled at the same time as any new exploratory well.\n\n;Foreign affairs\nGrayson has been an outspoken critic of the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]]. In May 2010, he introduced the [[War Is Making You Poor Act]]. The bill would require the president to fund the wars from the Department of Defense's base budget. The bill does not necessitate an end to the wars or mandate a cut-off date. In addition to the tax cuts, the bill would cut the federal deficit by $15.9 billion.<ref name=\"open congress1\"/>\n\nGrayson has tried to combat wasteful spending by government defense contractors by introducing his \"Gold Plating Amendment\". The amendment would require that cost or price account for half of the evaluation of bids for defense contracts. The law at the time allowed for cost to account for only 1% of the evaluation. The amendment passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act in June 2009. However, the language was stripped from the final bill during the conference committee between Senate and House leaders.
