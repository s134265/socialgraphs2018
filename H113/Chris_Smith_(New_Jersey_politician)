On the issue of stem cell research, Smith has actively worked to increase research into non-embryonic stem cells. Smith's \"Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005\", which provides $265 million for stem cell therapy, umbilical [[cord blood]] and bone marrow treatment was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] in December 2005.\n\nIn July 2006, Smith voted to uphold President Bush's veto of legislation that promoted embryonic stem cell research<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep.

Smith also is vice-chairman of the Committee on International Relations and as of 2011 became Chairman of the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (also known as the United States Helsinki Commission), which works to promote and foster democracy, human rights, and stability in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nSince being elected to Congress, Smith has also played a key role over the years promoting human rights reforms in the former Soviet Union, Romania, Vietnam, China, Sudan, Cuba, and elsewhere. He wrote the provision of the law that barred the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (as the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] was formerly known) from training in the United States with U.S. law enforcement personnel until it was certified that the police met stringent human rights standards. That certification was issued in December 2001 by President [[George W. Bush]].\n\nOne of Smith\u2019s significant legislative achievements is his landmark Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Law, the nations' first law that deals specifically with human trafficking. This law provided government prosecutors with the resources needed to prosecute offenders as well as resources to help victims rebuild their lives.\n\nSmith began investigating and working to end the human trafficking epidemic in the mid-1990s. Trafficking is a $9 billion industry, the third largest source of income for organized crime and the second fastest growing criminal activity in the world, equal with illegal arms sales.\n\nIn 2003, a second Smith trafficking law\u2014the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\u2014took effect and further strengthened his original law. Smith\u2019s original trafficking law also reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, the most significant law to help protect women who are victims of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Like the trafficking component, the VAWA reauthorization works to ensure prosecution of offenders and help the victims recover.\n\nIn January 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] signed Smith\u2019s third trafficking law\u2014the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005, which strengthens the nation\u2019s current trafficking law (which he also authored in 2000), authorizes new funds for investigation and prosecution of domestic trafficking within the United States and to helps the young women and children who are most often the victims of human trafficking operations.\n\nSmith has strongly criticized [[China]] for its forced sterilizations and abortions and its persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, and opposed normal trade relations with China. In July 2003, after a provision for $50 million for the [[United Nations Population Fund]] passed by one vote in committee, he led the fight against it and it was defeated on the floor 216\u2013211.\n\nSmith has condemned [[Russia]] for barring entry of foreign [[Roman Catholic]] priests and the Saudis for treating foreign servants as slaves. In 2000 he had the signal success of pushing to passage a bill combating sex trafficking around the world, including a provision opposed by the Clinton administration requiring yearly reports on each nation's record; Clinton signed it anyway. In 2003, he worked to extend it to 2005. Smith has also taken action on the subject\u2014when he heard about [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] girls being held against their will in brothels in [[Montenegro]], he called the Montenegrin prime minister, who ordered a raid on the operation. He has worked to secure grant funding for Project Polaris, a New York-New Jersey group combating sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grant Will Help Fight Trafficking in NJ|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=56974|work=Congressman Chris Smith: News|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSmith has also been a strong supporter of issues of importance to Armenian Americans including U.S. recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Smith public statements on Armenian Genocide|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/public-statements/26952/chris-smith/?search=Armenian#.UTEevOiUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 he successfully sponsored a law providing $81 million for centers in the U.S. and abroad to counsel victims of torture. In July 2004 the House passed 323\u201345 his bill to bar increased aid to [[Vietnam]] unless the administration finds substantial progress toward releasing political prisoners and fostering religious freedom and democratic government.\n\nSmith's moral views have led him to take stands unusual for a Republican on domestic issues. In July 2003 he cast a critical vote in committee for [[Henry Waxman]]'s resolution of approval for future global climate change agreements. In October 2004, he voted against [[James Sensenbrenner]]'s amendment broadening the category of illegal immigrants subject to immediate deportation.\n\nSmith was a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident; during the [[Goldman child abduction case]],<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=111-h20090603-55 Rep Chris Smith: On Sean Goldman - Justice Delayed Again]</ref> traveling with him to Brazil, advocating for him in Congress and writing H.R. 2702 to suspend Brazil's [[Generalized System of Preferences]] trading benefit,<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2702&tab=summary H.R. 2702: To suspend the application of Generalized System of Preferences for Brazil until such time as...]</ref> as well as H.R. 3240 the \"International Child Abduction Prevention Act of 2009\"<ref>http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.3240.IH:</ref> He has subsequently spoken several times on [[international child abduction]] generally and on [[International child abduction in Japan]] specifically.\n\nIn May 2012, while holed up in the United States Embassy in Beijing, Chinese dissident [[Chen Guangcheng]] telephoned Smith to seek his advice.  Smith suggested that Chen seek to depart China and continue to push for human rights in China from outside the country.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304020104577384253042010624.html From China Activist's Flight, a Diplomatic Crisis]</ref>  After leaving the embassy, and while being treated at a Beijing hospital, he telephoned Smith during a session of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/03/politics/obama-china/?hpt=hp_t1 Chen case is another human rights issue for Obama]</ref>  Smith spoke with Chen and allowed Chen to make statements and ask questions to those present in the Committee room.<ref>[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/hearings/general/hearing6/index.php Recent Developments and History of the Chen Guangcheng Case]</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, Smith voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.

Smith's 2004 bill increased from 18 to 24 months the coverage of the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]], set up a pilot program for recruitment of nurses, and authorized a new research center of veterans with multi-trauma combat injuries.\n\nVeterans Laws Authored by Smith include one providing a record 46 percent increase in the [[GI Bill]], which helps veterans pay for college. The increase is the largest ever since the GI Bill went into effect following [[World War II]].\n\nSmith also wrote the nation's first law that addresses and combats the plague of chronic homelessness among veterans. The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act authorizes $1 billion in programs to help veterans find and retain jobs and provides them with housing, counseling, and medical care they need to rebuild their lives.\n\nFor three years, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] explicitly forbade spending on Smith's four research centers to develop responses to chemical, biological and radiological attacks. In early 2003, Smith called for making veterans benefits an entitlement\u2014mandatory spending that would not have to go through Appropriations. GOP leadership opposed and there were threats he'd lose the chair. In 2003, he voted for the Republican budget resolution that included a $1.8 billion increase in veterans spending, but in July 2003, appropriators did not include the money; Smith opposed that but disappointed Democrats by not voting against the vote sending the measure to the floor.\n\nSmith did not expect a challenge for the chair when Congress convened in 2005. But [[Steve Buyer]], the fourth ranking Republican on the committee, asked for an interview with the [[Steering and Policy Committee of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Steering Committee]], and on January 5, 2005, it voted to make him chairman. That decision was ratified by the Republican Conference on January 6\u2014Smith was off the committee altogether. He was obviously disappointed. \"I don't look at power as something to hold. I see the power of the gavel as a strategic opportunity to do good, to use it in every way to help veterans,\" he said in his speech to the Conference. New Jersey Republicans expressed dismay, and New Jersey Democrats and the leaders of just about every veterans group expressed outrage.\n\n===Legislation===\nOn May 6, 2014, Smith introduced the bill [[International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573; 113th Congress)]], which would require the notification of foreign governments when an American registered as a [[sex offender]] of children is going to be traveling to their country.<ref name=MoodyYahooMay20>{{cite news|last=Moody|first=Chris|title=House prepares for rare votes on standalone bills to curb human trafficking|url=http://news.yahoo.com/house-prepares-for-rare-votes-on-standalone-bills-to-curb-human-trafficking-142803176.html|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=Yahoo!
