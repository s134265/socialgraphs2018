As a staffer to Representative Dellums, she traveled to Grenada to have the government there vet the report Representative Dellums planned to present to Congress. In the report Representative Dellums planned to state that the airport would not pose a military threat to United States national security.  As noted in Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60 on page 163, \"Another document retrieved after Grenada's liberation provided the postscript. In a diary entry dated March 22, 1980, Grenadian Defense Minister Liam James had written: \"The Revo[lution] has been able to crush counter revolution internationally. Airport will be used by Cuban and Soviet military.\"\" She ran for Congress in a [[special election]] that created a year-long series of five special elections as various East Bay politicians vied for political office. (For a detailed account of these elections, see [[Special election musical chairs]].)\n\n===AUMF opposition===\nLee gained national attention in 2001 as the only member of congress to vote \"No\" on the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), stating that she voted no not because she opposed military action but because she believed the AUMF, as written, granted overly-broad powers to wage war to the president at a time when the facts regarding the situation were not yet clear. She \"warned her colleagues to be 'careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target.'\"<ref>Polner, Murray (2010-03-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/ Left Behind], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Lee explained, \"It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events\u2014anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration.... The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action.\"\n\nThis vote made nationwide news reports and brought about a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office. Although it appears to have reflected the beliefs of the majority of her constituents, the majority of responses from elsewhere in the nation were angry and hostile, some referring to her as \"communist\" and \"traitor\".
