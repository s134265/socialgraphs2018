In 1974 Rush left the Panthers, who were already in decline. \"We started glorifying thuggery and drugs,\" he told ''People''. Rush, a deeply religious born-again [[Christian]], went on to say that \"I don't repudiate any of my involvement in the Panther party\u2014it was part of my maturing.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Almanac of American Politics |publisher= National Journal Group}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Rush earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] with honors in [[liberal arts]] from [[Roosevelt University]], and went on to earn his [[Master's degree]] in [[political science]] from [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in 1974, and in [[theology|theological studies]] from [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in 1978.\n\n==Chicago politics==\nRush ran for a seat on the [[Chicago City Council]] in 1974, the first of several black militants who later sought political office, and was defeated. In the early 1980s however, Chicago's political life was transformed by the ascendancy of U.S. Representative [[Harold Washington]], a noted orator and a charismatic figure who helped unite the city's African-American community. Washington was elected [[Mayor of Chicago]] in 1983, the first African-American to ever hold the office. That same year, Rush was elected alderman from the Second Ward on Chicago's South Side. He was a part of the pro-[[Harold Washington]] faction on the Council during the \"[[Council Wars]]\" that began in 1983 following Washington's election as Mayor in a racially-polarized contest.\n\nIn 1999, Rush ran for [[Mayor of Chicago]], but lost in the Democratic primary to incumbent [[Richard M.
