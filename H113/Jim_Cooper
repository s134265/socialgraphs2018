The new 4th ran diagonally across the state, from heavily [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] areas near [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]], [[Knoxville]] and [[Chattanooga]] to the fringes of the Nashville [[suburb]]s. The district stretched across five media markets - the Tri-Cities (Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol), Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and [[Huntsville, Alabama]] - so the 1982 race had much of the feel of a statewide race. Owing to the district's demographics, many felt that whoever won the election would almost instantly become a statewide figure with a high potential for election to statewide office in the future. Cooper defeated Cissy Baker, an editor in Washington for the Cable News Network and the daughter of U.S. Senate Majority Leader [[Howard Baker]]<ref>{{cite news  |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925782,00.html |title=The House: Political Genes and Reaganomics |work=Time (magazine) |date=Oct 4, 1982}}</ref> with 66 percent of the vote. He was reelected five more times with little substantive opposition, running unopposed in 1986 and 1988. This was somewhat surprising, given the district's volatile demographics.  The district, then as now, was split between areas with strong Democratic and Republican voting histories.  Indeed, prior to Cooper's election, much of the eastern portion of the 4th hadn't been represented by a Democrat since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. However, the size of the district makes it extremely difficult to unseat an incumbent.\n\n===Tenure===\nCooper has always been a staunch supporter of the [[National Rifle Association|National Rifle Association (NRA)]] and the movement to loosen federal gun laws, and during his 1984 election campaign, the NRA donated a sum to his campaign that approached the legal limit of $10,000.<ref name=\"Secter\">{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1091947272.html?dids=1091947272:1091947272&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+11%2C+1986&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Victory+Spotlights+Power%2C+Strategy+of+NRA+Lobbyists&pqatl=google | first=Bob | last=Secter | title=Victory Spotlights Power, Strategy of NRA Lobbyists | date=April 11, 1986}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 Cooper was co-author of a bipartisan health-care reform plan, that did not include employer mandates compelling [[universal health care|universal coverage]].

Cooper received just under 40 percent of the vote. It was a bad year overall for Democrats in Tennessee, as Republican [[Bill Frist]] captured Tennessee's other Senate seat and [[Don Sundquist]] was elected governor. The 4th district seat was also won by a Republican, [[Van Hilleary]], as the GOP gained a majority of the state's congressional delegation for only the second time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\n==Inter-congressional years (1995-2002)==\nAfter losing his Senate bid, Cooper moved to Nashville and went into private business, also serving as a professor at [[Vanderbilt University]]'s [[Owen Graduate School of Management]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives (2002-Present)==\n\n===Elections===\n;2002\nWhen Thompson opted not to run for a second full Senate term in 2002, 5th District Congressman [[Bob Clement]] (with whom Cooper had served from 1988 to 1995) ran for Thompson's seat. Cooper entered the Democratic primary along with several other prominent local Democrats. Having not won the 5th or its predecessors since 1874, Republicans had long since given up on it; the last serious GOP bid for the 5th had been in 1972. It was generally understood that whoever won the Democratic primary was all but assured of victory in November. Cooper won the primary with 44 percent of the vote, all but assuring his return to Congress after an eight-year absence. Cooper defeated his opponent in the general election by an overwhelming margin.\n\n;2004\nCooper was re-elected in 2004 against a Republican who disavowed his party's national ticket.\n\n;2006\nIn the 2006 election, Cooper faced Tom Kovach, the state public relations coordinator for the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]], who ran as a Republican since the Constitution Party did not have [[ballot access]] in Tennessee at the time. No one opposed Kovach for the Republican nomination. Cooper defeated Kovach by 41 points.\n\n;2008\nOn Election Day 2008, Cooper defeated Republican John Gerard Donovan 68%-31%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tennessee 2008 Election Results|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G08/TN.phtml|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n;2010\nCooper defeated Republican David Hall 57%-42%.<ref>{{cite news|last=George|first=Stephen|title=Democrat Rep.

This led to speculation that the legislature might try to draw the 5th out from under Cooper.  Indeed, in the summer of 2011 Cooper and [[List of mayors of Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville Mayor]] [[Karl Dean]] told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that they'd heard rumors about heavily Democratic Nashville being split between three Republican districts.  Despite its large size, Nashville has been located entirely or mostly in a single district since Reconstruction.  Cooper said he'd gotten his hands on a map that would have placed his home in Nashville into the heavily Republican [[Tennessee's 6th congressional district|6th District]].  The 5th would have been reconfigured into a strongly Republican district stretching from [[Murfreesboro]] to the Alabama border, while the rest of Nashville would have been placed in the heavily Republican [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th District]].  Had it been implemented, the map would have left Cooper with only two realistic places to run\u2014an incumbent-versus-incumbent challenge in the 6th against freshman Republican [[Diane Black]], or the reconfigured 5th, which had reportedly been drawn for State Senator and Murfreesboro resident [[Bill Ketron]], chairman of the redistricting committee.<ref>Sisk, Chas.

Although the 5th is only a marginally Democratic district on paper at D+5, more than two-thirds of its vote is cast in Nashville/Davidson County, which has double the population of the rest of the district combined.  However, Cooper has seldom if ever faced any significant challenge to his ideological left, or even threats thereof, given the historical strength of the Davidson County organization. A more recent reason for Cooper's clout among voters, though, is the control of the state legislature by Republicans, who might divide the district in the future, or merely threaten to do so, to thwart any possibility of a nationally-aligned liberal taking the seat (see above). Those fears work strongly in Cooper's favor, in addition to his nearly lifelong connections with establishment figures in Tennessee, and will probably continue to do so in the near future.\n\nIn July 2011, Cooper was one of five Democrats to vote for the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Russell|title=Five Blue Dogs join GOP in vote for 'cut, cap and balance' bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/172441-five-blue-dogs-join-gop-in-vote-for-cut-cap-and-balance-bill|publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''|accessdate=23 July 2011|date=19 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Rep.
