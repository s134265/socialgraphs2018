He sought a rematch in 2000 and lost by only 5,400 votes, while [[George W. Bush]] narrowly carried the district.\n\nAfter the 2000 census, Minnesota's congressional map was radically altered, though the number of districts was unchanged.  The old 28-county 2nd District was dismantled, and a new 2nd District was created in the Twin Cities' southern suburbs.  At the same time, the 6th District was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican than its predecessor.  The remapping left the home of the 2nd District's freshman incumbent, Republican [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]], just inside the reconfigured 6th District.  Realizing this, Kline immediately filed for the Republican nomination in the new 2nd District; his home had been drawn into this district.  After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the 2nd as well, even though it was thought to lean slightly Republican.\n\nDuring the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the \"No New Taxes Party.\"  This was done in retaliation for an ad the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. <ref>Scheck, Tom.

[[Minnesota Public Radio]], August 22, 2002.</ref>  Kline gained considerable momentum from this, and ultimately won handily, taking 53% of the vote to Luther's 42%.\n\nKline then defeated Democratic [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]] City Councilwoman [[Teresa Daly]] to win a second term in 2004 and former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent]] and [[whistleblower]] [[Coleen Rowley]], one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine's]]'' \"Persons of the Year\", with 56% of the vote in 2006. In 2008 Kline defeated former [[Watertown, Minnesota|Watertown]] mayor [[Steve Sarvi]] and increased his margin of victory to over 57% of the vote.\n\nKline accepted $11,000 in political contributions from former congressman [[Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham]]'s PAC. After Cunningham\u2019s indictment on fraud charges, Kline donated the money to charity.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20051202-9999-1n2giveback.html Some Republicans are dumping donations given by Cunningham] Accessed August 12, 2006</ref>\n\nKline's reelection in 2012 made him the 40th U.S. Representative from Minnesota to win six House terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/07/john_kline_six_going_on_seven.php |title=John Kline: Six Going on Seven? |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=July 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign Financing===\n\nSo far during the 2014 campaign, Kline's largest campaign contributor has been the [[Apollo Group]],  an S&P 400 corporation that owns several for-profit educational institutions through its subsidiaries, including the [[University of Phoenix]].
