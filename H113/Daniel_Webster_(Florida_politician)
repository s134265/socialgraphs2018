He has been a resident of Florida since the age of seven and resides in [[Winter Garden, Florida]].\n\nFirst elected in 1980, Webster served 28 years in the state legislature in [[Tallahassee]], becoming the longest serving legislator in Florida history.<ref name=press/> During that time, he rose to become [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives]] and [[Florida Senate]] [[majority leader]],<ref name=\"prepare\"/> and left the legislature only after reaching the legal term limits in 2008.<ref name=\"Kelly falls\"/> He ran unopposed in all of his elections for the state legislature except for the first three; 1980, 1982, and 1984.<ref name=interview/>\n\nWebster was first elected to Congress in 2010. In November 2012, Webster defeated [[Val Demings]], the former [[Chief of Police]] of the [[Orlando Police Department]], to secure re-election.\n\n==Early life, education, and business career==\nWebster was born in [[Charleston, West Virginia]] and raised in [[Orlando, Florida]] where his family moved when Webster was seven, upon a doctor's recommendation that a change of climate might cure Webster's sinus problems.<ref name=Hollis/> He is a distant relative of the antebellum politician and orator [[Daniel Webster]].<ref name=interview/>\n\nHe attended the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], where he was student government [[chaplain]] from 1970 to 1971 and a member of the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity.<ref name=Hollis/><ref name=house/> He graduated in 1971 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]].<ref name=house/> Upon graduation, Webster's Vietnam war era student deferment expired and he became eligible for [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] into the U.S. military. He was not drafted, however, because he failed the physical exam due to lifelong foot problems which prevent him from standing for long periods of time.<ref name=\"Grayson criticized\"/>\n\nSince college Webster has worked in the family air conditioning and heating business; he presently owns and operates it.<ref name=Hollis/><ref name=PBP/> Webster lives in [[Winter Garden, Florida]].<ref name=\"one by one\"/>\n\n==Florida House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n;1980\nWebster first decided to run for the Florida House in 1979 at the age of 30. He had been working on a project with his church to convert a residential house into a place for [[Sunday school]] to be conducted. When the [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] commissioners rejected the church's request for a zoning exception, Webster investigated and found that the county commission had rejected every zoning exemption request brought before them by a church or religious organization. Seeking to rectify what he thought an injustice, Webster decided to run for public office after finding no politician who shared his displeasure with local and statewide government.<ref name=Hollis/>\n\nIn the Republican primary, Webster ranked first with 38%, but failed to obtain the 50% threshold necessary to avoid a run-off election.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=41145</ref> In the run-off, he defeated Barbara Owens 54%-46%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=41146</ref> In the general election, he defeated Democrat State Representative Henry Swanson 51%-49%, a difference of just 2,070 votes.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=41142</ref> The race came down to one precinct, Webster's own [[Pine Hills, Florida|Pine Hills]], which he won.<ref name=interview/>\n\n;1982\u20141984\nAfter redistricting, he decided to run in the newly redrawn Florida's 41st House District. He won re-election to a second term by defeating [[Craig Crawford]] 58%-42%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=41131</ref> In 1984, he won re-election to a third term against State Representative Dick Batchelor, 54%-46%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=41130</ref><ref name=\"7 Floridians\"/>\n\n;1986\u20141996\nAfter defeating Batchelor in 1984, he never had another election opponent in the State House of Representatives as he won re-election unopposed each two years thereafter.\n\n===Tenure===\nWebster was first elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1980. There, he served as Minority Floor Leader, and then Minority Whip. In 1996, when the Republicans gained a majority in the House, Webster became the first Republican Speaker of the Florida House in 122 years. He remained Speaker until 1998 when [[term limit]]s made him ineligible to run for re-election to the state House.<ref name=PBP/><ref name=\"tax\"/>\n\nDuring his tenure as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Webster received recognition and awards from a number of organizations, including the American Heart Association for support of AHA priority issues (1996), the Board of Regents Legislative Award (1995), the Florida Association of State Troopers Leadership Award for Excellence in Legislative Leadership (1996), the Florida Banking Association Award (1995), the [[Florida Chamber of Commerce]] Legislator of the Year (1995), the Florida Farm Bureau Legislative Award (1995), the Florida Hotel and Motel Association Special Recognition Award (1995), the Florida League of Cities Quality Floridian (1995), the Florida Medical Association recognition award (1996), and the Republican Party of Florida Statesman of the Year award (1995).<ref name=house/>\n\n;Education\nWebster's first bill to become law was the 1985 Home Education Program Act which legalized [[Homeschooling in the United States|homeschooling]] in Florida. He considers it his most significant legislation.<ref name=\"interview\"/> He homeschooled his six children, remains a homeschooling advocate,<ref name=interview/> and a member of a non-denominational Christian organization that promotes homeschooling, the [[Institute in Basic Life Principles]].<ref name=\"tv ad\"/> While Speaker of the House in 1997, Webster insisted that legislation providing funding to schools must balance the needs of all school districts and not raise any new taxes.<ref name=\"school districts\"/> He agreed to a school construction plan funded by borrowing up of to 2.5 billion in bonds, though he thought the crowding problem was being exaggerated for political purposes.<ref name=\"school districts\"/><ref name=\"cash ready\"/><ref name=\"2.7 billion\"/> He also sponsored 1998 legislation to improve and streamline pre-kindergarten education and provide training for parents who would be homeschooling their children.<ref name=\"give kids\"/>\n\n;Marriage\nIn 1990, Webster sponsored and supported legislation in Florida introducing the policy of [[covenant marriage]].
