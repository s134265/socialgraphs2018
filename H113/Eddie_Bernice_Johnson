An [[African-American]], she is the first registered nurse elected to the U.S. Congress.\n\n== Early life, education, and medical career ==\n\nBorn and reared in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]], Johnson's first aspirations were in medicine. She could not attend college in her own state because of her race, so she left Texas and attended [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]] in South Bend, Indiana, where she received a diploma in nursing in 1956. She transferred to [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], from which she received a bachelor's degree in nursing. She later attended [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and earned an [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|title=JOHNSON, Eddie Bernice, (1935 - )|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000126|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref> She served as Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital (the first African American to hold that position), and entered politics after 16 years in that position.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hon.

Johnson left the state House in 1977, when President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed her as the regional director for the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]], the first African American woman to hold this position.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eddie Bernice Johnson (D)|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/22368/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nJohnson entered politics again in 1986, and was elected a [[Texas Senate|Texas state Senator]], becoming the first female and African-American from the Dallas area to hold this office since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Her particular concerns as a Senator included health care, education, [[public housing]], racial equity, [[economic development]], and job expansion. She served on the Finance Committee, for which she chaired the subcommittee on Health and Human Services, and on the Education Committee. Her interest in health care led her to write legislation to regulate diagnostic radiology centers, require drug testing in hospitals, prohibit discrimination against [[AIDS]] victims, improve access to health care for AIDS patients, and prohibit hospital kickbacks to doctors. As a [[fair housing (United States)|fair housing]] advocate, she sponsored a bill to empower city governments to repair substandard housing at the expense of landlords, and wrote a bill to enforce prohibitions against housing discrimination.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fair housing bill proposed|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w5M9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6TUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6922,6217253&dq=eddie-bernice-johnson+fair+housing&hl=en|newspaper=The Bonham Daily Favorite|date=December 22, 1988}}</ref>\n\nAs a lawmaker, Johnson was able to bring to a public forum her fight against racism, though she faced discrimination herself in the legislature. \"Being a woman and being black is perhaps a double handicap,\" she told the ''Chicago Tribune''. \"When you see who's in the important huddles, who's making the important decisions, it's men.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Korosec|first=Thomas|title=Eyes On Texas: Where Men Are Men And Women Run For Public Office|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-08-19/features/9003090294_1_lone-star-state-texans-men-and-women/2|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 19, 1990}}</ref> Johnson sponsored several bills aimed towards equity, including a bill to establish goals for the state to do business with 'socially-disadvantaged' businesses, and crafted a fair housing act aimed at toughening up fair housing laws and establishing a commission to investigate complaints of [[housing discrimination (United States)|discriminatory housing practices]].\n\nIn addition to her legislation, Johnson held hearings and investigated complaints. In 1989, she testified in a federal court about racism in the Dallas city government. In 1992, she formally asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to investigate harassment of local black students. That same year, she held hearings to examine discrimination charges about unfair contracting bids for the government's [[Superconducting Super Collider]]. One thing Johnson fears most about discrimination is the legacy it leaves for youth. \"I am frightened to see young people who believe that a racist power structure is responsible for every negative thing that happens to them,\" she explained to the ''New York Times''. \"After a point it does not matter whether these perceptions are true or false; it is the perceptions that matter.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Suro|first=Roberto|title=In Dallas, Race Is at the Heart Of City Politics|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/weekinreview/in-dallas-race-is-at-the-heart-of-city-politics.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 10, 1989}}</ref>\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n===Elections===\nMidway through her second term in the state senate, Johnson opted to run in the Democratic primary for the newly-created 30th congressional district.

Vera]], she won re-election to a third term with just 55% of the vote, the worst election performance of her congressional career.  However, this election was held under unusual circumstances.  All of the candidates in the race appeared on a single ballot regardless of party, and Johnson faced two other Democrats.  Proving just how Democratic this district still was, the three Democrats tallied 73 percent of the vote between them. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30082 |title=TX District 30 Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}</ref> Johnson has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected 18 more times with at least 72% of the vote. In the most recent cycle Johnson easily beat two opponents in the Democratic Primary, State Representative Barbara Mallory Caraway and lawyer Taj Clayton, gaining 70% of the vote; she went on to win the general election by a landslide, gaining almost 79% of the votes cast.<ref>{{cite web|first=Elected Officials Directory|title=US House District 30|url=http://www.texastribune.org/directory/districts/us-house/30/|publisher=Texas Tribune|accessdate=5 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nThe 17th chair of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], she was a leading voice in opposition to the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002]]. During debate on the House floor, she stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"I am not convinced that giving the President the authority to launch a unilateral, first-strike attack on Iraq is the appropriate course of action at this time. While I believe that under international law and under the authority of our Constitution, the United States must maintain the option to act in its own self-defense, I strongly believe that the administration has not provided evidence of an imminent threat of attack on the United States that would justify a unilateral strike. I also believe that actions alone, without exhausting peaceful options, could seriously harm global support for our war on terrorism and distract our own resources from this cause.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=E.

She was the first African-American and first female in Congress to hold the position of this Subcommittee Chair. While holding the position of Subcommittee Chair, Congresswoman Johnson sponsored the [[Water Resources Development Act]]. She successfully secured and led Congress in overriding President Bush\u2019s veto of it. This was the only veto override during his presidency.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson's Biography|url=http://ebjohnson.house.gov/ebj-bio/|publisher=House.gov|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2007 primary campaign, Johnson initially supported U.S. Senator [[John Edwards]] for President.  After his withdrawal from the race, she pledged her support as a superdelegate to [[Barack Obama]] and her district backed Obama heavily in the 2008 election.\n\nRecently, the Congresswoman, along with Rep. Donna Edward (D) proposed a publicly funded park on the moon to mark where the Apollo missions landed between 1969 and 1972.The Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, H.R. 2617, calls for the park to be run jointly by the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).<ref>http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/309829-dems-propose-historical-park-on-the-moon</ref>\n\n====Scholarship violations====\n\nIn August 2010, Amy Goldson, counsel for the [[Congressional Black Caucus Foundation]], said that Johnson violated organizational rules by awarding scholarship money to four relatives and two children of a top aide. Awards come with an anti-[[nepotism]] rule, and winners must live or study in the Congress member's district. Johnson said she \"unknowingly\" made a mistake in awarding the grants and would work with the foundation to rectify it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/082910dntexcongress.2c049bb.html |title=Rep.

And I knew that they had a need just like any other kid that would apply for one.\"\n\nSoon after Johnson denied having involvement in the scholarship process, opponent [[Stephen Broden]] released letters bearing Johnson's signature in which the representative requested that the scholarship check be made and sent directly to her relatives instead of to the University as would normally be procedure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/dallas/headlines/20100907-Letters-bearing-Eddie-Bernice-Johnson-s-4984.ece|title=Letters bearing Eddie Bernice Johnson's signature ask that scholarship money be sent directly to her grandsons|work=Dallas Morning News|author=Todd J.
