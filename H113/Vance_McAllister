With   18 percent of the vote, McAllister finished second among fourteen candidates in the first round of balloting held on October 19.

In the first round of balloting, Riser led McAllister by nearly  15,000 votes and carried thirteen of the twenty-four parishes in the district.\n\nMcAllister was the leading votegetter only in West Carroll and [[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland]] parishes but ran a strong second to Riser in Ouachita Parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10192013/10192013_Congressional.html|title=Results for Election Date: 10/19/2013|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> As the top two candidates, Riser and McAllister entered the runoff contest.\n\nThe catalyst for McAllister's strong showing in the race is believed in part to have been the celebrity endorsement of [[Phil Robertson]] of the ''[[Duck Dynasty]]'' [[television series]], which is filmed in [[West Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]].

McAllister opposed the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]] as a proper method to force the repeal of the measure: \"Obamacare is a nightmare, but it's a reality, and it's here.

Riser endorsed the House approach of piecemeal immigration reform, rather than the comprehensive route favored by the [[U.S. Senate]].<ref name=nriser/>\n\nThough Louisiana's congressional delegation supported Riser, McAllister won the support of the third-place special election candidate, [[Jamie Mayo]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[mayor]] of Monroe.

Instead, McAllister urged Jindal, who while speaking in [[Iowa]] dismissed the McAllister candidacy out of hand, to spend more time with his own voters in Louisiana. \"Tell the governor, I said 'thank you' [for the nonendorsement]\", McAllister said.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/mcallister-thanks-jindal-nonendorsement/13978119/|title=McAllister 'thanks' Jindal for nonendorsement|publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk''|author=Greg Hilburn of Gannett Louisiana|date=August 12, 2014|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>McAllister had criticized Jindal for declining to expand [[Medicaid]] in Louisiana, which has a considerable population of workers unable to afford health insurance.<ref name=hardestworker/>\n\nThe Glascock Group poll released September 3 showed Dr. Abraham had taken the lead in the race with 22 percent support. McAllister was then rated a strong second with 20 percent, Jamie Mayo third at 15 percent, businessman Harris Brown fourth at 11 percent, Public Service Commissioner Clyde Holloway fifth at 9 percent, Zach Dasher sixth at 7 percent, Ed Tarpley seventh at 6 percent, and Monroe attorney Jeff Guerriero (who quickly withdrew from the race, citing the demands of his law office) and Green Party candidate Eliot Barron tied for eighth place at 4 percent each. McAllister's 20 percent poll support coincided exactly with the 20 percent who rated his congressional performance as \"excellent\". Another 18 percent rated McAllister \"very poor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/03/abraham-jumps-mcallister-th-district-poll/15025625/|title=Abraham jumps McAllister in 5th District poll|author=Greg Hilburn|date=September 3, 2014|publisher=''The Monroe News-Star''|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDespite what appeared to be an endorsement of McAllister in 2013, Phil Robertson withdrew his support for the congressman and instead endorsed his own nephew, Zach Dasher. Robertson said that McAllister had told him in 2013 that he stands with God and family, and \"two months in he's messing with some chick.\" McAllister said that he was \"disappointed\" that \nRobertson is \"speaking against the words that he writes about, like forgiveness, when we're all sinners. ...
