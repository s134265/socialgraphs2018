He graduated from [[Nottingham Senior High School]] in 1986, and continued on to receive a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history from [[Brown University]] in 1990, an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in journalism from the [[Columbia University]] [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Graduate School of Journalism]] in 1991, and an [[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] from the [[John F.

Kennedy School of Government - News]</ref>\n\nUpon graduating from Columbia, Maffei went to work as a reporter and producer for Syracuse's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WSYR-TV]] from 1991 to 1993, and part-time reporter for [[WWNY-TV]] in Watertown from then until 1995. \n\nMaffei was the Senior Vice President for Corporate Development at consulting firm Pinnacle Capital Management,.<ref>[http://www.pcm-advisors.com/html/people.html Pinnacle Capital Management People]</ref>\n\n== Early political career ==\nDan's career on Capitol Hill started with an unpaid internship in 1996 with New York Congressman Eliot Engel. He was hired as a press secretary for U.S. Senator [[Bill Bradley]] in 1996, then served in the same post for Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] from 1997 to 1998. After working on Senator Bradley's [[President of the United States|presidential]] campaign from 1998 to 1999, Maffei went to work for U.S. Representative [[Charlie Rangel]] from 1999 to 2005, serving as a senior staff member of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]].\n\nIn 2005, Maffei returned to Syracuse to coordinate the successful 2005 re-election campaign of Syracuse [[Mayor]] [[Matt Driscoll]]. Following his successful return, Maffei decided to make his first bid for public office, challenging popular nine-term Republican Congressman [[James T. Walsh|Jim Walsh]]. He earned the Democratic nomination and mounted the first serious challenge to Walsh in years, coming within two percentage points of defeating the incumbent.  Maffei won in the City of Syracuse and the rest of [[Onondaga County]], Walsh's home turf, as well as [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives (2009-2011; 2013-present)==\n\n===Elections===\n;2008\n{{see also|New York's 25th congressional district election, 2008}}\nOn January 24, 2008, after Maffei had already mounted a strong opposition campaign, Walsh announced that he would not be running for an 11th term. In March, 2008, Mayor Driscoll announced he would not be running for the seat, effectively handing the nomination to Maffei. He ran unopposed in the Democratic primary on September 9, 2008. After it appeared he might run unopposed in the general election, on April 3, 2008, Onondaga County legislator [[Dale Sweetland]], coming off a narrowly unsuccessful 2007 bid for Onondaga County Executive, announced that he would oppose Maffei.\n\nMaffei was heavily favored to win the seat. In addition to rating the district as 'Leans Democratic', \n''[[RealClearPolitics]]'' ranked this as the third most likely Congressional district to switch parties.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/election_2008/battle_for_congress.html Election '08: Senate, House & Governor Races]</ref> Going into the election, other pundits from ''[[CQ Politics]]'', ''The Cook Report'', and the ''Rothenberg Report'' are also ranking it as 'Lean Democrat' to 'Democrat Favored'.<ref name=\"cqpolitics.com\">[http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=28 CQ Politics Projected Landscape, New York's Delegation to the U.S. House]</ref> \n\nIn May 2008, and again on June 20, 2008, the ''[[Washington Post]]'''s [[Chris Cillizza]], author of \"The Fix\", ranked the race in the 25th as a near-certainty to result in a Democratic takeover.<ref>Chris Cillizza. \"[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/05/friday_house_line_double_your.html Friday House Line: Dems Could Gain 20 Seats]\", \"The Fix\", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', June 6, 2008.

Retrieved on June 28, 2008\n</ref>  Although Walsh had held the seat without serious difficulty until his near-defeat in 2006, the 25th had swung heavily to the Democrats at most other levels since the 1990s.  Even though Republicans have a small plurality of registered voters, it hadn't supported a Republican for president since [[George H.W. Bush]] carried it in 1988.  Walsh had been able to hold onto the seat due to his long tenure on the [[House Appropriations Committee]], which made Maffei's near-victory in 2006 all the more remarkable.  It is normally considered very difficult to unseat an Appropriations Committee member.\n\nOn November 4, 2008, Maffei defeated Sweetland, 55% to 42%.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapHNY/H/25 US House - New York 25 Results</ref>  He became the first Democrat to represent the area since 1981 (when it was the 32nd District).\n\n;2010\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010#District 25}}\n[[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] [[Ann Marie Buerkle]] defeated Maffei on November 2, 2010 following weeks of absentee ballot counting and precinct recanvassing, in which Buerkle emerged with a 567-vote majority of over 200,000 ballots cast.
