In the discussion leading up to his vote, Congressman Scott fielded several different points of view. On August 6, 2009, Scott was confronted by a local doctor who claimed to live in Scott's district.  The doctor, who later appeared in subsequent debates with his opposition candidate, asked Scott why he was going to vote for a health care plan similar to [[Massachusetts health care reform|the plan implemented in Massachusetts]] and if he supported a government-provided health care insurance option. Scott questioned whether or not the doctor was a resident of Scott's district, although the local TV station [[WXIA-TV]]'s news department confirmed that the doctor did live and work in Scott's district.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Carpenter\n  | first = Amanda\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Georgia Democrat yells at local doctor over health care\n  | work = Washington Times\n  | place =\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = \n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/back-story/2009/aug/08/georgia-democrat-rages-against-local-doctor-over-h/\n  | accessdate = 2009-08-09}}</ref>\n\nMany others in attendance, however, were later discovered not to be residents of the 13th Congressional District and were 'planted' there by a vocal opposition minority.
