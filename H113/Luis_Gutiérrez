Guti\u00e9rrez, who had never before visited the island, reluctantly followed his parents; there he learned to speak Spanish.

To fund his campaign Guti\u00e9rrez returned to driving a cab seven days a week, 14 hours a day. Guti\u00e9rrez's work as a taxi driver grew his campaign fund to $6,000, against which Rostenkowski had hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Guti\u00e9rrez collected over three-fourths of the 2,200 signatures he needed to quality for the ballot on his own.

Guti\u00e9rrez declared his candidacy for alderman of the 26th ward and soon received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington.  At the time of the election opponents to Washington's administration, led by [[Edward Vrdolyak|Ed Vrdolyak]] of the 10th ward, controlled the City Council.  This divide within city government was dubbed by the Chicago media as [[Council Wars]].  The 1986 special elections gave Washington the opportunity to take control of the city council.  Because the six other special elections were all but decided, control of the council came down to the race in the 26th ward.  [[Manuel Torres]], then a member of the Democratic machine and Cook County Commissioner also entered the race for 26th ward Alderman.  Torres was endorsed by Vrdolyak, former mayor [[Jane Byrne]], future mayor and then State's Attorney [[Richard M. Daley]], and machine Alderman [[Edward M.

Guti\u00e9rrez, who spoke Spanish during the debate, outperformed Torres, who chose to speak entirely in English. Guti\u00e9rrez's use of Spanish and his grassroots organizing are credited for his 53%\u201347% victory over Torres.  Guti\u00e9rrez is reported to have said during the election: \"My supporters could give a damn about the Democratic Party.

He was also a proponent of local economic development and construction of affordable housing.  He was referred to as a \"workhorse in the city council\" by political author Marable Manning.<ref name=\"Fremon 1988\"/>  \n\nIn the 1987 municipal elections Guti\u00e9rrez faced five opponents and be re-elected to the City Council with 66% of the vote.<ref name=\"Fremon 1988\"/> Following Washington's death and the battle over who would succeed the deceased Mayor, Guti\u00e9rrez voted for African-American Alderman [[Timothy C.
