However, this was not considered an upset.  The 6th had been trending Republican for some time as Nashville's eastern suburbs bled into the western portion of the district from the 1980s onward. The district had increasingly assumed a character similar to other affluent suburban districts in the South.  Although Gordon had only faced three reasonably well-funded challengers since winning the seat in 1984, it was considered very likely that the 6th would be taken by a Republican once Gordon retired.  As it turned out, national Democrats wrote off the seat as a Republican pickup after no well-known local Democrats expressed interest.\n\n===Romney Campaign===\nIn the 2012 general election, Black was a surrogate for Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/romney-may-have-edge-in-battle-of-the-spinners/</ref> Black made appearances for Romney in Pennsylvania,<ref>http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=419890</ref> Wisconsin,<ref>http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/sep/22/tennesseans-head-elsewhere-for-presidential/?print=1</ref> and in various cable news interviews.<ref>{{YouTube|XWXjIfBwfBY}}</ref>\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on the Budget|Committee on the Budget]]'''\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]]'''\n**[[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources|Subcommittee on Human Resources]]\n\n*[[Tea Party Caucus]]\n*[[Republican Study Committee]]\n\n===Tenure===\nOn October 30, 2013, Black introduced the [[Student and Family Tax Simplification Act (H.R. 3393; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to consolidate several different education tax incentives into an expanded [[American Opportunity Tax Credit]].<ref name=AccountingTodayCohn>{{cite news|last1=Cohn|first1=Michael|title=House Passes Student Tax Credit Simplification Bill|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/government-news/house-passes-student-tax-credit-simplification-bill-71453-1.html|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Accounting Today|date=24 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=3393sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3393 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3393|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> The American Opportunity Tax Credit, under this legislation, would provide a maximum credit of $2,500.<ref name=MarcosTaxCredit>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passess tax credit for college expenses|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/213291-house-passes-tax-credit-for-college-expenses|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Past Endorsements==\n*Governor Sarah Palin <ref>http://www.sarahpac.com/candidates?page=7</ref>\n*The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) <ref>http://www.nfib.com/article/?cmsid=60648</ref>\n*Governor Mitt Romney <ref>http://blogs.tennessean.com/politics/2010/mitt-romney-endorses-diane-black/</ref>\n*The National Rifle Association (NRA) <ref>http://www.nba.com/</ref>\n*Congresswoman Michele Bachmann <ref name=\"realclearpolitics.com\">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/news/ap/politics/2012/Jul/29/black__zelenik_battle_for_6th_district_again.html</ref>\n*Former Congressman Alan West <ref name=\"realclearpolitics.com\"/>\n*Tennessee Right to Life <ref>{{YouTube|Yz6GyDhlZnE}}</ref>\n*Susan B.
