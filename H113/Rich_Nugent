He also opposed the Obama Administration's $862 billion stimulus package, which was an attempt by President Obama to bolster a damaged economy.\n\nNugent has pledged to fight to reduce spending in Washington. He also believes that parts of government spending (including the Health Care Law) are unconstitutional.  He claims that his main reason for opposing continued deficit spending is simply that American families just cannot afford it anymore.
