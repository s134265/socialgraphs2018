Waters asserted in 2007 that President George W. Bush was trying to \"set [Congress] up\" by continually requesting funds for an \"occupation\" that is \"draining\" the country of capital, soldier's lives, and other resources.  In particular, she argued that the very economic resources being \"wasted\" in Iraq were those that might provide universal health care or fully fund President Bush's own \"[[No Child Left Behind]]\" education bill.  Additionally, Waters, representing a congressional district whose [[median income]] falls far below the national average, argued that patriotism alone had not been the sole driving force for those U.S. service personnel serving in Iraq.<!-- IRRELEVANT <ref>[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html]</ref> --><!-- IRRELEVANT [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_35th_congressional_district] -->  Rather, \"many of them needed jobs, they needed resources, they needed money, so they're there.\"<ref>[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/ca35_waters/FS071022_iraqwar.html]</ref>  In a subsequent floor speech, Waters told her colleagues that Congress, lacking the votes to override the \"inevitable Bush [[veto]] on any Iraq-related legislation\", needed to \"better [challenge] the administration's false [[rhetoric]] about the Iraq war\" and \"educate our constituents [about] the connection between the problems in Pakistan, Turkey, and [[Iran]] with the problems we have created in Iraq.\"<ref>[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/ca35_waters/FS071106_iraq.html]</ref>  A few months prior to these speeches Waters became a [[sponsor (legislative)|cosponsor]] of the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House]] resolution to impeach [[Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] for making allegedly \"false statements\" about the war.<ref>[http://washingtontimes.com/national/20070613-113033-5031r.htm Washington Times \u2013 Cheney ouster gains backers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===International lending===\nIn August 2008, Waters introduced HR 6796, or the \"Stop Very Unscrupulous Loan Transfers from Underprivileged countries from Rich Exploitive Funds Act\", also known as the Stop VULTURE Funds Act.
