This amendment continues his longtime opposition to abortion. According to [[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]], a contributing editor for Harper's, Pitts is a documented member of the Bible-oriented Christian group \"[[The Fellowship (Christian organization)]]\" and the C Street group in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the [[112th Congress]], Pitts introduced the Protect Life Act, which would place additional restrictions on abortion access.\n\nIn July 2011, Pitts was revealed, in course of an [[FBI]] investigation, to have accepted tainted funds traced to the intelligence services of [[Pakistan]].<ref>http://thepennsylvaniaprogressive.com/diary/3485/joe-pitts-took-pakistani-money</ref> These funds were routed through the so-called Kashmiri American Council (KAC), run by [[Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai]], who was convicted of several felonies by the Federal government.  Pitts later donated these funds to charity.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n====Legislation====\nOn March 26, 2014, Pitts introduced the [[Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress)]] into the House.
