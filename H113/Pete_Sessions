He toured the district with a livestock trailer full of horse manure, claiming that the [[Clinton Administration]]'s health care plan stank more than the manure. He lost by 2,400 votes. He subsequently became vice president for public policy at the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]] (NCPA), a Dallas-based conservative public policy research institute.\n\nIn 1996, when Bryant decided to seek a [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat, Sessions was elected to succeed him in the 5th District, defeating Democratic candidate John Pouland with 47 percent of the vote.\n\nHe was re-elected in 1998, defeating schoolteacher Victor Morales with 56 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2000, he ran against [[Regina Montoya Coggins]], and was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote.\n\nWhen redistricting after the 2000 Census made the 5th slightly more Democratic, he moved to the newly created 32nd District for the 2002 election, in which he ran against Pauline Dixon and won the district with 68 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2004, Sessions defeated 13-term, [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] Congressman [[Martin Frost]], who had moved to the 32nd after the [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistricting in 2003]] eliminated Frost's former district. He won 54-44%, in what was considered the most expensive U.S. House race in the nation. According to the ''Associated Press'', \"The race also was one of the nastiest, with Frost unearthing a decades-old streaking incident by Sessions in his college days and questioning his commitment to security with an ad featuring the [[World Trade Center]] towers in flames. In response, he criticized Frost for booking [[Peter Yarrow]] of the 1960s group [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] for a fundraiser. Yarrow had faced an indecency with a child charge years earlier.\"\n\nIn 2010, he faced [[Dallas]] businessman and attorney [[Grier Raggio]] and Libertarian John Jay Myers.
