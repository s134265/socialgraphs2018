In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]].\n\nDuring his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revises and simplifies direct payment programs for crops and eliminates milk price supports through direct government purchases.\n\nIn the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted \"coup\" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out.

He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats\u2014along with dissenting Republicans\u2014would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker.

The election followed [[Tom DeLay]]'s resignation from the post after being indicted on criminal charges. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called \"[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]\" process and rein in government spending. He defeated Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]] and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], even though he was considered an underdog candidate to Blunt. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as [[Majority Whip]], the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,<ref>{{Wayback |date=20060204102043 |url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call }}</ref> due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortu\u00f1o]] of Puerto Rico to vote or not).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader.  While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]], as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans.  As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.  While the Speaker is nominally elected by the full House, in practice he or she is almost always chosen by the majority party.\n\nAccording to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20080918155340 |url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt }}</ref> As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].\n\n==Speaker of the House==\n[[File:Obama Boehner State of the Union 2011.jpg|thumb|Speaker Boehner greets U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] before the [[2011 State of the Union Address]].]]\nThe Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats.
