He defeated the 1992 Republican nominee, Steve Hamrick, in the primary, and then narrowly defeated freshman Democratic Congressman [[Thomas Barlow (politician)|Tom Barlow]] by only 2,500 votes. He narrowly defeated Dennis Null in 1996 even as [[Bill Clinton]] carried the district, but hasn't faced a close race since.  Although Democrats have a nearly 2-to-1 edge in registration, they tend to be very conservative on social issues, a trend that has helped Whitfield strengthen his hold on the district.\nWhitfield\u2019s major legislative accomplishments are creating the 170,000 acre of National Recreation Area at the Land between the Lakes, introducing and passing legislation to create a Health Compensation Program at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion plant. He paid over $315,000,000 in compensation to the 3,139 employees and survivors. He also helped create the first Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plan for seniors and is an active advocate for the humane treatment of animals. <ref>{{cite web|last=NA|title=Congressman Ed Whitfield|url=http://whitfield.house.gov/about/biography|accessdate=3/8/2012}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhitfield's wife, Constance Whitfield, is a former Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] and now a paid lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons}}\n*[http://whitfield.house.gov/ Congressman Ed Whitfield] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.whitfieldforcongress.com/ Ed Whitfield for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Kentucky/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Ed_Whitfield_%5BR-1%5D}}\n*{{CongLinks | congbio = w000413 | ballot = Ed_Whitfield | nndb = 880/000040760 | votesmart = 21873 | govtrack = 400431 | opencong = 400431 | rollcall = 196 | politifact = | cspan = 36978 | fec = H4KY01040 | opensecrets = N00003467 | assets = edward-whitfield/ | legistorm = 532/Rep_Wayne_Edward_Whitfield.html | followthemoney = | ontheissues = House/Ed_Whitfield.htm | congress = edward-whitfield/1222 | worldcat = np-whitfield,%20edward%241943 | imdb = 4349962 | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = gIQAhbJcKP }}\n\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox |\n  state=Kentucky|\n  district=1 |\n  before=[[Thomas Barlow (politician)|Thomas Barlow]] |\n  start=1995}}\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Mac Thornberry]]<br><small>R-[[Texas]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=''[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]''|years=82nd}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Elijah Cummings]]<br><small>D-[[Maryland]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{KY-FedRep}}\n{{USCongRep-start|congresses= 104th\u2013113th [[United States Congress]]es |state=[[Kentucky]]}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/104}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/105}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/106}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/107}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/108}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/109}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/110}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/111}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/112}}\n{{USCongRep/KY/113}}\n{{USCongRep-end}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Whitfield, Ed\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American politician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =May 25, 1943\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Whitfield, Ed}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:American University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Kentucky alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Kentucky College of Law alumni]]\n[[Category:Wesley Theological Seminary alumni]]\n[[Category:American Methodists]]\n[[Category:Kentucky lawyers]]\n[[Category:Kentucky Republicans]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Members of the Kentucky House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:People from Hopkinsville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:People from Madisonville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Delta Tau Delta members]]"}]}}}}
