The [[Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, Marchant has the fifth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog - Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|date=August 8, 2008 |url= http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}} Retrieved on August 8, 2008</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nMarchant had planned to run for Congress two years earlier in a bid to represent the newly created {{ushr|Texas|32|32nd district}} in suburban Dallas, but fellow Republican [[Pete Sessions]], an incumbent, chose to run there instead. During the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Marchant, in his position on the Texas House's Redistricting Committee, was ideally positioned to help draw Texas districts.  As part of this effort, the 24th District, represented by 13-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Martin Frost]], was reconfigured from a heavily Democratic district with a sizable Latino population into a heavily Republican district that was over 73 percent white.  While [[Al Gore]] easily carried the old 24th in the 2000 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] would have won the new 24th with a staggering 68 percent of the vote.  Marchant was elected to Congress in 2004, and was reelected in 2006 (with 60% of the ballots cast) and 2008 (with 56% of the ballots cast).\n\n==Personal life==\nMarchant is married to Donna Marchant and has four children as well as two grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Kenny|url=http://marchant.house.gov/biography/}}</ref> They live in [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], a Dallas suburb.\nMarchant's son Matthew Marchant is the current mayor of [[Carrollton, Texas]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marchant.house.gov/ Congressman Kenny Marchant] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.kennyforcongress.com/ Kenny Marchant for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Texas/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Kenny_Marchant_%5BR-24%5D}}\n*{{CongLinks | congbio = m001158 | ballot = Kenny_Marchant | nndb = 221/000086960 | votesmart = 5549 | govtrack = 400656 | opencong = 400656 | rollcall = 18463 | politifact = | fec = H4TX24094 | opensecrets = N00026710 | assets = kenny-marchant | legistorm = 350/Rep_Kenny_Marchant_TX.html | followthemoney = 16639 | ontheissues = TX/Kenny_Marchant.htm | congress = kenny-marchant/1806 | worldcat = | cspan = 1013059 | imdb = | bloomberg = | nyt = | wsj = | washpo = gIQAZ91QKP }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox\n| state=Texas\n| district=24\n| before=[[Martin Frost]]\n| years=2005\u2013Present\n| after=Incumbent}}\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Dan Lipinski]]<br><small>D-[[Illinois]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=''[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]''|years=183rd}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Michael McCaul]]<br><small>R-[[Texas]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{TX-FedRep}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Marchant, Kenny\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American politician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =February 23, 1951\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Bonham, Texas]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marchant, Kenny}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Texas]]\n[[Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Mayors of places in Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Carrollton, Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Bonham, Texas]]\n[[Category:Southern Nazarene University alumni]]\n[[Category:American members of the Church of the Nazarene]]\n[[Category:Texas city council members]]\n[[Category:People from Coppell, Texas]]\n[[Category:Tea Party movement activists]]\n[[Category:Texas Republicans]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]"}]}}}}
