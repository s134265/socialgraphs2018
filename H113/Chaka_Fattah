Since its inception, more than $4 billion in federal funds have been distributed to assist 12 million students in 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.  Fattah sponsored H.R. 4207, American Dream Accounts Act which  would authorize the Department of Education to award three-year competitive grants to support partnerships that provide financial support and preparation for low-income students as they plan for their college education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Adds Financial Piece to GEAR UP|url=http://www.crewof42.com/featured/fattah-adds-financial-piece-to-gear-up/|publisher=Crew of 42}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The \"Assets Effect\"|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/julyaugust_2012/features/the_assets_effect038418.php|publisher=The Washington Monthly}}</ref>  The bill is co-sponsored in the U. S. Senate by Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Senator Mark Rubio of Florida and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. Specifically the legislation creates personal online accounts for students that monitor higher education readiness and includes a college savings account. The accounts follow students from school to school and through college. Parents can grant vested stakeholders (including counselors, teachers, coaches, mentors, and others) access to the account to update student information, monitor progress, and provide college preparatory support.\n\nFattah has introduced a few bills targeting the equity of resource allocation within and between school districts. In 2002, he introduced the \"Student Bill of Rights\", H.R. 2451.<ref>{{cite web|title=SENATOR DODD AND REPRESENTATIVE FATTAH INTRODUCE THE STUDENT BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2002|url=http://www.all4ed.org/publication_material/straight_as/09092002#Rights|publisher=Alliance for Excellent Education}}</ref>  The measure calls for States to provide highly effective teachers, early childhood education, college prep curricula and equitable instructional resources to all students who attend public schools.

The [[tax credit]] assists any full-time college or university student or their families that claim the credit. Since 2011, it has assisted 4.5million students and their families.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} AOTC provides up to $2500 tax credit for families to assist them with the cost of college. The credit is unique in that families under a set income without a tax liability are eligible for a tax rebate. President Obama has called for making the tax credit permanent.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\nOutside of legislative work Congressman Fattah has created a few local education initiatives for Philadelphia and Pennsylvania families as a state legislator and in cooperation with state and municipal governments, including the CORE scholars program and the annual Grad Conference.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nCollege Opportunity Resources for Education (CORE) is a Philadelphia city-wide{{which|date=September 2012}} initiative providing almost $27 million in last-dollar scholarships to over 18,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=CORE Scholarships|url=http://www.corescholars.org/about/}}</ref>  The program encourages the students to participate in service to the local community and provides technical assistance to the families of program participants ensuring that they apply for educational assistance programs ([[Pell Grant]]s, [[PHEAA]] grants, etc.) offered by the state and federal government.\n \nA report issued by the National Student Clearinghouse  concludes that participants in CORE are more likely than their fellow non-CORE classmates to complete their college education in four years.<ref>{{cite web|title=CORE Annual Report 2011|url=http://www.corescholars.org/core-scholarships-annual-report-2011/}}</ref>\n\n====Youth Mentoring====\nCongressman Fattah is the lead Democrat responsible for the funding of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[United States Attorney General]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Statement at Subcommittee Markup of the FY13 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill|url=http://democrats.appropriations.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=965&Itemid=17}}</ref>  Since 2011, the Congressman was able to negotiate an increase of $30M to investment in DOJ programs that fund groups including the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America]] and [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nIn 2012, Fattah negotiated a partnership between [[FIRST]] and Boys & Girls Clubs of America to provide robotics programs to 4 million youth by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=FIRST \u00ae Announces Strategic Alliance with Boys & Girls Clubs of America|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-announces-strategic-alliance-boys-211200140.html|publisher=Yahoo Finance}}</ref>\n\n====Neuroscience====\nCongressman Fattah is the lead Democrat responsible for funding some of the largest science agencies in the federal system (NASA, NSF, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Committee on Appropriations- Democrats|url=http://democrats.appropriations.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84&Itemid=17}}</ref> In December 2011, Fattah through his role on the Appropriations Committee, directed the OSTP to establish an Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience (IWGN].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Neuroscience Amendment Passes|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fattah-neuroscience-amendment-passes-151901895.html}}</ref>  Housed within the White House and chartered on June 20, 2012, the IWGN convenes representatives across the Federal government to make recommendations about the future of neuroscience research.\n \nThe Fattah Neuroscience Initiative is a policy initiative designed to make major progress understanding the human brain by intensifying, in a collaborative fashion, federal research efforts across brain disease, disorder, injury, cognition and development.<ref>{{cite web|title=FATTAH NEUROSCIENCE INITIATIVE|url=http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=295&sectiontree=4,295}}</ref> The initiative aims to coordinate Federal research across agencies and draw upon public-private partnerships and the world of academia.

He touted the possibility that such a system would bring in so much money it would allow for greatly increased federal spending, saying the \"excess funds\" would \"provide universal health care, support an equitable public school finance system, and fund economic development in urban and rural areas,\" in addition to extinguishing the national debt and eliminating all other federal taxes.<ref>[http://www.factcheck.org/2010/09/1-transaction-tax/ 1% Transaction Tax].
