The Democrats were optimistic in part because the 2nd district has historically been friendlier to Democrats than the rest of Utah and in part because two-term incumbent [[Merrill Cook]] had a reputation for erratic behavior.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e2173.htm | work=USA Today | title=Smith upsets incumbent Cook | date=June 28, 2000}}</ref> The prospect of losing the seat frightened district Republicans enough that Cook was unseated in the primary by computer executive Derek Smith. However, Matheson defeated Smith comfortably, taking 56 percent of the vote even as George W. Bush won the district with 57% of the vote.\n\n===2002===\nDuring the 2000s round of redistricting, the Republican-controlled state legislature [[gerrymandering|significantly altered]] Matheson's district. The old 2nd had been located entirely in [[Salt Lake County]] since the 1980s round of redistricting; Salt Lake County has historically been friendlier to Democrats (at least at the state and local level) than the rest of Utah. The legislature drew all or part of 14 mostly rural counties in eastern and southern Utah into the 2nd. They were only connected to Salt Lake City by a narrow band of territory in heavily Republican [[Utah County]]. In addition, the legislature shifted most of western Salt Lake City to the 1st, leaving the more conservative eastern part of the city in the 2nd. The new district was approximately six points more Republican than its predecessor. Matheson was thought to face difficult odds for reelection, even though his family has roots in southern Utah.\n\nAs expected, the 2002 race was very close. Matheson defeated State Representative [[John Swallow]] by only 1,600 votes, largely due to a 25,800-vote margin over John Swallow in Salt Lake County.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2002/pages/states/UT/H/02/county.000.html |title=Election 2002 \u2013 County Results: Utah House 02 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> According to at least one study, some extra financial help from the Republican Party might have helped Swallow defeat Matheson. However, national Republicans stayed out of the race after state legislators claimed they had drawn a district that no Democrat could possibly win.<ref>http://csed.byu.edu/Assets/Pew/2002%20Monograph.pdf</ref>\n\n===2004===\nMatheson defeated Swallow again\u2014this time by a 12-point margin even as Bush won the state by a large margin (and carried the district with 67 percent of the vote).\n\n===2006===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Utah, 2006#Second District}}\nMatheson defeated State Representative [[LaVar Christensen]] by 22 points.\n\n===2008===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Utah, 2008#District 2}}\nMatheson defeated Republican challenger [[Bill Dew]] in the 2008 general election by 28 percent.\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Utah, 2010#District 2}}\nMatheson won against Republican nominee [[Morgan Philpot]]. In May, Matheson faced his first challenge from within his party. Claudia Wright claimed that Jim Matheson was not liberal enough and obtained 45% of the vote at the Democratic State Convention, forcing a primary for the Democratic nomination. After weeks of campaigning Matheson secured the Democratic nomination, by obtaining 67.5% of the vote.\n\n===2012===\nMatheson had said he was considering a run for statewide office in 2012, particularly if his seat was substantially changed in redistricting.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lisa Riley Roche |title=Two Utah Political Heavyweights Eyeing Key Races |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705374250/Two-Utah-political-heavyweights-eyeing-key-races.html |work=Deseret News |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 }}</ref> Polling conducted in July 2011 showed Matheson leading incumbent Republican Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] in a possible 2012 Senate race.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lisa Riley Roche |title=Poll: Time for Senator Hatch To Go |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700145325/Poll-Time-for-Senator-Orrin-Hatch-to-go.html |work=Deseret News |date=June 18, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn December 15, 2011, Matheson announced that he would run for the newly created seat in the [[Utah's 4th congressional district|4th congressional district]], meaning there would be an open-seat race for the 2nd district.
