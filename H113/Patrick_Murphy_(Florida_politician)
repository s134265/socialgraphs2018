The arrest affidavit said Murphy and his friend were escorted from the club by security, appeared drunk and were disrupting business and assaulting customers, with Murphy receiving a black eye from a fight. After being warned they would be arrested if they didn't leave, Murphy and his friend left in a cab, but the cab returned with the driver complaining that the passengers were drunk and refused to pay. The intoxication charge was ultimately dropped for lack of evidence and the [[fake ID]] charge was dismissed.
