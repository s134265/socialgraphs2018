He worked for [[Eugene McCarthy]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 U.S. presidential campaign]]. Nadler became involved in a controversy with the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 1995, when he wanted the release of data concerning a bank for which the FDIC was then the receiver.\n\nThe result of the dispute was a key [[Second Circuit]] precedent on the applicability of the [[Freedom of Information Act]] to circumstances in which a public agency possesses \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential\".\n\n==New York Assembly==\n\n===Elections===\nBetween 1977 to 1983 in the 69th Assembly District. After redistricting, his district was renumbered 67 and he served with that number until 1992.\n\nIn 1985, he ran for [[Manhattan Borough President]]. He lost the Democratic primary to [[David Dinkins]] 65%&ndash;35%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=86503].</ref> In the general election, he ran as the [[New York Liberal Party]] nominee and was defeated by Dinkins 77%-12%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=81971].</ref>\n\nIn 1989, he ran for [[New York City Comptroller]]. In the Democratic primary, he lost to [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], who won with a plurality of 47% of the vote. Nadler ranked fourth with 4% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=113209].</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nHe is credited with authoring legislation dealing with domestic violence and child support enforcement, and was one of the architects of the \"Child Support Adjustment Act\". Nadler was the only male to be honored as \"Assemblymember of the Year\" by the National Organization for Women due to his inclusion on the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]s Annual Honor Roll. It was also during his Assembly years that Nadler honed his expertise on issues of urban infrastructure.\n\n===Committee assignments===\nNadler founded and chaired the Assembly Subcommittee on Mass Transit and Rail Freight.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1992, [[Ted Weiss]] was expected to run for re-election in the 8th District, which had been renumbered from the 17th after the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 U.S. Census]]. However, Weiss died a day before the [[primary election]]. Nadler was nominated to replace Weiss. He ran in two elections on Election Day{{spaced ndash}} a special election to serve the rest of Weiss's term, and a regular election for a full two-year term.  He won both handily, and has been re-elected ten times with little serious competition in one of the most Democratic districts in the country.
