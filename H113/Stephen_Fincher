Most state and local officials are Democrats, and congressional elections usually saw Democrats skate to reelection.  However, it has become increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level since the turn of the 21st century.  In the 2008 presidential election, Republican U.S. Senator [[John McCain]] carried the district with 56% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-2010-TN-08 |accessdate=Sep 14, 2010 |work=CQ Politics |title=Tennessee - 8th District}}</ref>\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Fincher defeated Herron, receiving 98,484 votes to Herron's 64,701, or approximately 60% of the vote.  Upon his swearing-in on January 3, 2011, Fincher became the first Republican to represent what is now the 8th District since 1898.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n;2012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2012#District 8*}}\nFincher's seat was made considerably safer after the 2010 census.  He lost his share of [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] while picking up some heavily Republican territory east of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] which had previously been in the 7th District.  This turned the 8th into one of the most Republican districts in the nation; with a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+19, it is the 11th most Republican district in the South.\n\nOn paper, this left Fincher vulnerable to a primary challenge from a Memphis-area Republican.  However, he won the Republican primary with 86% of the vote over Annette Justice, a youth worker from [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]].  He then defeated Democrat Timothy Dixon in the general election with 68% of the vote.\n\n;2014\nOn November 4, 2014, Fincher was elected to a third term by his widest margin, securing approximately 73% of the vote.\n\n===Tenure===\n\nFincher is a fiscal and social conservative, who at the same time benefits from government farm subsidies.  He is strongly pro-life and pro-gun, and opposes same-sex marriage.  On the issues section of his Website, he lists his top priority as restoring \"limited government.\"  He does not consider himself a traditional politician; his slogan in 2010 was \"My roots are in Tennessee, not in politics.\"<ref>[http://www.stephenfincher.org/issues Fincher's issues page]</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, Fincher was named one of the \"Most Corrupt Members of Congress\" for 2011 by [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]], specifically citing the Gates Banking loan.<ref>[http://www.nwtntoday.com/news.php?viewStory=61172 Staff and AP reports. \"CREW names Fincher among worst in Congress\" [[The Messenger (Tennessee)|''The Messenger'']] September 22, 2011]</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Fincher received the largest election contribution from the NRA; more than any US Senator or Representative.<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000082]</ref>\n\n====Food stamps====\nIn May 2013, Fincher argued for large cuts to the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp program along with his House Republican colleagues.
