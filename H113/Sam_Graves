Graves filed within the short period of time left for filing. Graves faced Representative Danner's son, Steve Danner, a former State Senator, in the general election. Graves referred to Danner as a \"tax and spend liberal\" and won the race with 51% of the vote <ref>http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=14&oid=3990&arc=1</ref> largely by running up huge margins in the rural areas of the district. He was arguably helped by [[George W. Bush]] carrying the district in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]].

He gained national attention early in the race for running an ad accusing Barnes of promoting \"[[San Francisco values]].\" It was initially considered one of the hottest races in the country. However, Graves won reelection fairly handily, taking 59 percent of the vote to Barnes's 37 percent. Because the district has historically not been considered safe for either party, elections in the district tend to be closely contested.\n\n===2010===\n{{See also| United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2010#District 6}}\nGraves defeated Democratic nominee Clint Hylton (an [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]] insurance agent who owned a farm in [[Polo, Missouri]]) and write-in candidate Kyle Yarber.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.house.gov/graves/ Congressman Sam Graves] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.gravesforcongress.com/ Sam Graves for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Missouri/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Sam_Graves_%5BR-6%5D}}\n*{{CongLinks | congbio = g000546 | ballot = Sam_Graves | nndb = 729/000038615 | votesmart = 9425 | govtrack = 400158 | opencong = 400158 | rollcall = 10812 | politifact = | fec = H0MO06073 | opensecrets = N00013323 | assets = samuel-graves | legistorm = 257/Rep_Samuel_B_Graves_Jr.html | followthemoney = 14446 | ontheissues = House/Samuel_Graves.htm | congress = sam-graves/1656 | worldcat = | cspan = 89873 | imdb = 0336350 | bloomberg = | nyt = | washpo = gIQAEvXIAP }}\n*[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Sam_Graves Profile] at [[SourceWatch]]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Pat Danner]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[Missouri's 6th congressional district]]|years=2001\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Chairperson of the [[United States House Committee on Small Business|House Small Business Committee]]|years=2011\u20132015}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Steve Chabot]]<br>{{small|Designate}}}}\n|-\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Susan Davis (politician)|Susan Davis]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]|years=126th}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Mike Honda]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{MO-FedRep}}\n{{US House Small Business chairs}}\n{{Authority control|VIAF=103526908}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Graves, Sam\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American politician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =November 7, 1963\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Tarkio, Missouri]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graves, Sam}}\n[[Category:1963 births]]\n[[Category:Baptists from the United States]]\n[[Category:Eagle Scouts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the Missouri House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Missouri]]\n[[Category:Missouri Republicans]]\n[[Category:Missouri State Senators]]\n[[Category:People from Atchison County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:University of Missouri alumni]]"}]}}}}
