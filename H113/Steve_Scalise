A Democrat, David Gereighty, polled 3,154 votes (10 percent) in the heavily Republican-oriented district. Scalise was succeeded in the state House by his aide, [[Cameron Henry]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].\n\nIn the special election on November 4, 2008 to fill the remaining three and one-half years in Scalise's state Senate term, [[Conrad Appel]] defeated Polly Thomas, 21,853 (52.1 percent) to 20,065 (47.9 percent).
