No [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], while Lamutt and Clay were both from [[Cobb County]]. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] with 63% and [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] with 35%. Lamutt carried [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] with 31% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4653</ref> In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%-46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=114737</ref> Price won the general election unopposed.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4101</ref>\n\n;2006\nIn 2006, Price drew one primary challenger, John Konop, who he easily defeated 82%-18%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=311132</ref> In November, he won re-election to a second term with 72% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206831</ref>\n\n;2008\u2013Present\nPrice won re-election in 2008 (68%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387947</ref> 2010 (100%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488686</ref> and 2012 (65%).<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=753473</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nIn 2011, he voted to prohibit funding of NPR,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2011-190 |title=GovTrack: House Vote On Passage: H.
