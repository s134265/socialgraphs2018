Bush|Bush administration]] suggested it would intervene in the labor dispute by using government troops to operate the ports, Hahn urged non-intervention.<ref name=\"stay away\"/> \"'There's no room for the federal government. There's only one reason for them to get involved, and that's to break the union,' she said.\"<ref name=\"stay away\"/> She was the leading force on the City Council behind both the passage of a living wage ordinance for the hotel workers along Century Boulevard near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the provision of improved health benefits to LAX employees.\n\nHahn cites her efforts to clean up the Port of Los Angeles as one of her main accomplishments while on the City Council.<ref name=\"campaign platform\"/> The 2006 Clean Air Action Plan, which she and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed forward, set a goal of reducing pollution by 45 percent within five years and shifted the movement of goods at the ports to off-peak traffic hours.<ref name=\"campaign platform\"/> Hahn also supported the addition of the Clean Trucks Program that requires the 16,000 diesel trucks serving the ports meet 2007 EPA emission standards within five years.<ref name=\"campaign platform\"/><ref name=\"clean truck\"/> She has noted that the ports have been Southern California's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and diesel emissions and that the Clean Trucks Program also provides for improved working conditions, wages and benefits for port truckers.<ref name=\"clean truck\"/> Prior to the Clean Air Action Plan, she had already shifted about 35% of goods to be moved during off-peak hours. Hahn also helped advance redevelopment projects at the Port of Los Angeles in both San Pedro and Wilmington.\n\nOn the City Council, Hahn was a major proponent of gang prevention, intervention, and suppression programs. She led the campaign to pass Measure A, which would have dedicated a sustainable revenue stream for those programs, but fell just shy of the two thirds percentage needed to pass. On a smaller level, she expanded the Gang Alternatives Program to all elementary schools in her district.\n\n==2010 Lieutenant Governor election==\n{{Main|California lieutenant governor election, 2010}}\nHahn ran for [[California Lieutenant Governor]] but was defeated in the primary by San Francisco Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]], finishing second in a field of three candidates.<ref name=\"lt gov\"/>\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives (2011-Present)==\n[[Image:Hahnwithspeaker.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Hahn is sworn into office by Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]] on July 19, 2011.]]\n\n===Elections===\n;2011\n{{Main|California's 36th congressional district special election, 2011}}\nOn February 7, 2011, Hahn announced her intention to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in the special election to fill California's 36th Congressional District seat vacated by Congresswoman [[Jane Harman]]'s departure to head the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\n[[Image:JaniceHahn2011.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Janice Hahn in 2011]]\nHahn was one of sixteen candidates from all parties who competed in the [[California's 36th congressional district special election, 2011|special election primary]] on May 17, 2011.<ref name=\"times endorses\"/> She finished first with 24 percent of the vote; Republican [[Craig Huey]] finished second with 22 percent.
