He is a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The district includes all or portions of ten counties in the northern-central part of the state, including portions of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]].\n\n==Early life, education, and pre-political career==\nCoble was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. After high school, he initially attended [[Appalachian State University]], but after a year joined the [[United States Coast Guard]], serving for over 5 years and staying on as a reservist for an additional 18 years. Upon discharging from military service, he attended [[Guilford College]], from which he received a history degree. He is a member of the Epsilon Iota Chapter of [[Pi Kappa Phi]] fraternity at [[The University of North Carolina at Greensboro]].  Coble then moved on to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and earned a degree in law.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Coble first worked as an insurance agent. He then spent nearly 20 years as a practicing attorney, and he was also Secretary of Revenue under North Carolina Governor [[James Holshouser]]. In 1979, Coble was elected to the [[North Carolina House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]], serving until his election to Congress.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n[[File:Howard Coble.jpg|thumb|right|Coble in 2007]]\n\n===Elections===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2012#District 6}}\nCoble was first elected to Congress in 1984, narrowly defeating Walter Cockerham in the primary 51%-49%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=66122</ref> In the general election, he defeated one-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] incumbent [[Robin Britt]] 51%-49%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52123</ref> Coble was likely the beneficiary of long coattails from [[Ronald Reagan]], who carried the district by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. In 1986, he defeated Britt in a rematch, which was an even closer 50.03%-49.97% and Coble won by only 79 votes (closest margin of victory that year). Since then, he has never won re-election with less than 61% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1404</ref> In July 2008, Coble won the Republican primary unopposed and became North Carolina's longest-serving Republican U.S. congressman, surpassing former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Broyhill]] (who was also elected to 12 terms but left the House in July 1986 to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat). Coble announced in 2013 that he would not run for another term in [[United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2014|2014]], and would retire after 30 years in Congress.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/rep-howard-coble-r-n-c-to-retire/ Washington Post]</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nIn the [[105th Congress|105th United States Congress]] Coble moved to suspend the rules and pass the [[NET Act]] on November 4, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of copyright violation.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r105:2:./temp/~r105t9SOlO:e46: Bill Summary & Status 105th Congress (1997 - 1998) H.R.2267 All Congressional Actions]</ref>  NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR02265:@@@Z Bill Summary & Status 105th Congress (1997-1998) H.R.2265]</ref>\n\nCoble is a strong supporter of agriculture and has voted in favor of bills to protect agriculture. Coble opposes further regulation of [[tobacco]] because he believes it will hurt North Carolina tobacco planters.\n\nCoble takes a hard-line position on illegal drugs, and co-sponsored a resolution to oppose the legalization and use of [[medical marijuana]].<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hj105-117 H.J.Res 117, 105th Congress]</ref> He also voted for an amendment to authorize [[drug testing]] on federal employees.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hj105-117 John Howard Coble on Drugs]</ref> However, he authored a resolution to celebrate the passage of [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], which repealed the Prohibition of [[alcoholic beverages]] in the United States.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hj105-117 H.Con.Res. 415, 110th Congress]</ref> Coble is also a member of the [[Tea Party Caucus]], joining [[Sue Myrick]] and [[Walter B. Jones]] as the sole members of the North Carolina Congressional delegation to join the group.\n\nCoble has pledged not to receive any pension from the [[United States government]].  He told [[CBS]] ''[[Up to the Minute]]'', \"I figured taxpayers pay my salary - not a bad salary, and I figure that's sufficient.  Let me fend for myself after the salary's collected.\" He also stated to CBS, \"I've pledged my assurance I won't take the pension. That's between my constituents and me. As far as convicted felons, I guess that's between their constituents and themselves.\"  He is one of two Congressmen, with [[Ron Paul]], to have pledged to decline his pension.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/22/eveningnews/main6011719.shtml |title=Pensions Follow Ex-Lawmakers to Prison |work=CBS News |date=December 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, during the government shutdown in October 2013.  Coble said that although 800,000 federal workers are furloughed and not receiving a paycheck, he will still collect his salary due to a requirement of law.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/03/cnn-keeps-count-congress-gets-paid-but-whos-keeping-their-paycheck/?hpt=hp_t1 |title=CNN Keeps Count... |work=CNN |date=October 3, 2013}}</ref>  Coble was one of the 87 Republicans who voted for the bill to end the shutdown on October 16.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/congress-votes-to-end-shutdown/house.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2013, Coble announced introduction of new legislation to reform the [[congressional pension]] program. Coble has refused to participate in the current congressional pension program, stating that reforming congressional pensions is long overdue and that the bill would lengthen the time of service required before a member would be eligible for participation in the pension program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coble.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=339584 |title=High Point Enterprise praises Coble pension bill |date=June 18, 2013 |website=house.gov |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Legislation sponsored===\nThe bill [[To extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 years (H.R. 3626; 113th Congress)]] was introduced in the House on December 2, 2013 by Coble.<ref name=3626allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3626 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3626/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> The bill would extend the [[Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988]] for an additional 10 years, but not expand any of its provisions (related to plastic guns).<ref name=foxnewsHousevotes>{{cite news|title=House votes to renew ban on plastic firearms|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/03/house-to-vote-on-banning-plastic-firearms/?intcmp=latestnews|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Foxnews.com|date=3 December 2013}}</ref> The bill passed the House on December 3, 2013.\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]]'''\n**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law|Subcommittee on Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law]] (Chairman)\n**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet|Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]]'''\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation|Subcommittee on Aviation]]\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation|Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation]]\n**[[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Highways and Transit|Subcommittee on Highways and Transit]]\n\n===Caucus memberships===\n*[http://Www.cfsi.org/congress_legislation/caucus.cfm Congressional Fire Services Caucus]\n*[[Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans]]\n*[[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]]\n*[[Republican Study Committee]]\n*Sportsmen's Caucus\n*[[Tea Party Caucus]]\n\n==Personal life==\nCoble is a member of the [[Guilford College]] Board of Visitors and of the [[U.S. Coast Guard Academy]] Board of Visitors.\n\nHe is a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and member of Guilford Lodge number 656 in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = Ric |date=July\u2013August 2012 | title = Masonic Hero Gets Rites at Reburial | journal = The North Carolina Mason | volume = 137 | number = 4 | pages = Page 5, 8 | location = Raleigh, NC, USA | publisher = Grand Lodge of A.F.&A.M. of North Carolina | format = PDF |accessdate=September 11, 2012 | url = http://www.epageflip.net/title/5206}}</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n{{s-start}}\n|+ {{ushr|North Carolina|6|}}: Results 1984&ndash;2012<ref name=\"clerk\">{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html|title=Office of the House Clerk \u2013 Electoral Statistics|publisher=Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=\"fedelect\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/electionresults.shtml|title=Election Results|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/42923/114645/Web01/en/summary.html |title=November 6, 2012 General Election |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>\n!
