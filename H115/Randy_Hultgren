The new district map (now featuring only 18 districts, and drawn by the Democratic-controlled [[Illinois General Assembly]]), saw Hultgren's district lose its vast western portion, becoming a much more compact district centered around the outer western suburbs of Chicago.\n\nThe new 14th included areas previously represented in the [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|8th district]], represented by fellow Republican [[Joe Walsh (Illinois politician)|Joe Walsh]]. The new map drew Walsh's home into the 14th while making the 8th significantly more Democratic, prompting Walsh to consider challenging Hultgren in the primary for the much friendlier 14th.  However, soon after Hultgren sought a second term in the 14th, Walsh decided to run in the 8th district. In the general election, Hultgren won re-election to a second term, beating Democratic candidate Dennis Anderson, with 59% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/IL|title=2014 Election Results Senate: Map by State, Live Midterm Voting Updates|work=POLITICO|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====2014====\n{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2014 #District 14}}\nHultgren ran for a third term and was opposed by Dennis Anderson for a second time.
