In response, he held a \u201cTele-Town Hall\u201d on February 7, 2017, which received mixed reviews as some accused Trott of 'cherry-picking' questions over the phone. In addition, over 150 individuals who signed up for the Tele-Town Hall ultimately never received a call to participate. No explanation or apology was provided for the exclusion.<ref>http://www.wxyz.com/news/angry-constituents-bring-chicken-to-town-hall</ref> During the congressional recess of 2017, individual constituents of Trott's District, Michigan  District 11, organized two separate Town Halls in hopes of enticing Trott to attend. Instead of meeting with his constituents, Trott chose to travel to India. Trott's office was not forthcoming with his schedule, and constituents found out about his trip via a story in the India Times just days before the first of the two Town Halls.<ref>http://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/this-month-27-us-congressmen-will-travel-to-india-ties-to-improve-significantly-271572.html</ref>\n\nAfter the congressional recess, constituents continued to encourage Trott to hold a town hall meeting where they could meet with their representative face-to-face. In some cases, constituents were turned away at the door of Trott's office and police were called to remove them.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Melissa|first1=Burke|title=Constituents demanding Trott meeting turned away |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/22/dave-trott-protest/98287706/|accessdate=22 March 2017|publisher=The Detroit News|date=22 February 2017}}</ref> Then, on March 18, 2017, Trott held a town hall meeting with a mixed crowd, admitting his supporters a full half hour before the general public and seating them in the first rows of the audience. The majority of the general public were those opposed to Trott. Despite the event being held at a large convention venue, seating for only approximately 250 was provided. The vast majority of the approximately 1,000 constituents who arrived were not admitted to the town hall due to space limitations, and many stayed throughout in protest through a very heavy snowfall.\n\nTopics discussed included the repeal and replacement of the [[Obamacare|ACA]] funding for social programs, and whether Trump\u2019s tweets were a good strategy. After the town-hall meeting, Trott and his aide, Stu Sandler, were caught on a hot mic stating \u201cWe\u2019re going to take that part where they\u2019re booing funding for the military and I\u2019m going to get somebody to write a story and we\u2019re going to promote the sh*t out of that\u201d, adding \u201cIt\u2019s un-American crap.\u201d An aide was also heard stating that they had \u201cbounced\u201d certain questions they did not want Trott to answer. Review of the tape shows that the booing begins after Trott said the American military was \u201cthe weakest it\u2019s ever been\u201d rather than related to military funding.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wiegel|first1=David|title=Hot mic catches GOP congressman\u2019s adviser planning spin about \u2018un-American\u2019 protesters |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/03/21/hot-mic-catches-gop-congressmans-adviser-planning-spin-about-un-american-protesters/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.trott.house.gov/ Congressman Dave Trott] official U.S. House website\n*[http://trottforcongress.com/ Dave Trott for Congress]\n* {{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Michigan/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Dave_Trott_%5BR-11%5D|Dave Trott}}\n* {{C-SPAN|davidtrott}}\n* {{CongLinks | congbio=T000475 | votesmart=152477 | fec=H4MI11097 | congress=david-trott/T000475 }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Kerry Bentivolio]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[List of United States Representatives from Michigan|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[Michigan's 11th congressional district]]|years=2015\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Norma Torres]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Seniority in the United States House of Representatives|United States Representatives by seniority]]|years=356th}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Mark Walker (North Carolina politician)|Mark Walker]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{USCongRep-start|congresses= 114th\u2013115th [[United States Congress]]es |state=[[Michigan]]}}\n{{USCongRep/MI/114}}\n{{USCongRep/MI/115}}\n{{USCongRep-end}}\n{{MI-FedRep}}\n{{U.S. Michigan Representatives}}\n{{USHouseCurrent}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trott, Dave}}\n[[Category:1960 births]]\n[[Category:21st-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:Duke University alumni]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Michigan Republicans]]\n[[Category:People from Birmingham, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan alumni]]"}]}}}}
