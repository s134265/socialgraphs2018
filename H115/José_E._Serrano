Serrano, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], represents a district that is one of the smallest in the country geographically, consisting of a few square miles of the heavily populated [[South Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. His district is also one of the most densely populated and one of the few majority Hispanic districts in the country. The district was numbered the {{ushr|NY|18|18th}} from 1990 to 1993 and the {{ushr|NY|16|16th}} from 1993 to 2013; it has been the {{ushr|NY|15|15th district}} since 2013.\n\n==Early life, education, and military service==\nSerrano was born in [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico]]. At the age of seven, Serrano was taken by his family to [[The Bronx]], where he was raised in the Millbrook Houses. Serrano went to Grace Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx and then attended [[Lehman College]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] medical corps from 1964 to 1966.\n\n==New York Assembly==\n\nHe was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1975 to 1990, sitting in the [[181st New York State Legislature|181st]], [[182nd New York State Legislature|182nd]], [[183rd New York State Legislature|183rd]], [[184th New York State Legislature|184th]], [[185th New York State Legislature|185th]], [[186th New York State Legislature|186th]], [[187th New York State Legislature|187th]] and [[188th New York State Legislature]]s. His district was numbered the 75th until 1982, and the 73rd from 1983 on. He was Chairman of the Committee on Consumer Affairs, and of the Committee on Education.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1990, Serrano won a special election for the seat vacated by resigning U.S. Congressman [[Robert Garcia (New York politician)|Robert Garc\u00eda]] with 92% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=107262|title=Our Campaigns - NY District 18 Special Race - Mar 20, 1990|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref> He has never won re-election with less than 92% of the vote,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.collegetermpapers.com/TermPapers/Government_&_Politics/Political_Profile_of_Jose_Serrano.shtml|title=Political Profile of Jose Serrano, Government & Politics - CollegeTermPapers.com|website=www.collegetermpapers.com|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bronxnewsnetwork.org/2010/11/bronx-general-election-results.html|title=Bronx General Election Results|website=www.bronxnewsnetwork.org|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref> in what is considered one of the safest seats in Congress.\n\nIn 2004, Congressman Serrano faced an electoral challenge from Jose Serrano, an unemployed former loading dockworker with the same name who eventually dropped out of the race in July.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/24/nyregion/seeing-double-on-ballot-similar-names-sow-confusion.html|title=Seeing Double on Ballot: Similar Names Sow Confusion|last=Hicks|first=Jonathan P.|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nA member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus|Progressive Caucus]], he is widely regarded as one of the most progressive members of Congress. He has been questioned about his [[pork barrel spending]] by some fiscal conservative members of Congress. [[Arizona]] Congressman [[Jeff Flake]] once said of Serrano's $150,000 [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] to repair the roof at the city-owned Arthur Avenue Market (a historic indoor produce and prepared food market in the Bronx's \"Little Italy\"), \"I would argue this is one [[cannoli]] the taxpayer doesn't want to take a bite of.\"<ref name=\"60minutes\">CBS ''60 Minutes'', [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/02/60minutes/main2145860.shtml ''Rep.

Consulted on June 27, 2007.</ref> Serrano replied to Flake, \"The more you get up on these, sir, the more I realize that you do not know what you are talking about. I make no excuses about the fact that I earmark dollars to go in the poorest congressional district in the nation, which is situated in the richest city on earth.\"<ref name=\"60minutes\"/>\n\nOn November 18, 2005, he was one of three votes in favor of immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. The other two votes were from [[Cynthia McKinney]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Robert Wexler]] of [[Florida]].<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/1526209 Rep.

Recently a beaver was discovered swimming in the river for the first time in 200 years, something seen as a testament to his efforts.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/nyregion/23beaver.html?_r=1&ei=5070&en=2ad9892ebc5bdc86&ex=1190088000&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1190442846-peEVm1IxNq5hjoihc46nkQ After 200 Years, a Beaver Is Back in New York City]</ref>  In 2007, he engineered the purchase of the last privately owned island in New York harbor\u2014[[South Brother Island, East River|South Brother Island]]\u2014for preservation in perpetuity by the City of New York as a wildlife refuge for rare shorebirds.\n\nSerrano is one of three New York-area congressmen on the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]], the others being [[Nita Lowey]] of the [[New York's 18th congressional district|18th district]] and [[Grace Meng]] of [[New York's 6th congressional district|6th district]]. He is currently the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services, having previously served as the chair.  As chairman, he successfully engineered the inclusion of language in the 2007 omnibus spending bill that guarantees the extension of the [[50 State Quarters]] program to include the minting of 6 additional quarters to honor the District of Columbia and the 5 United States territories, including Serrano's native Puerto Rico.\n\nSerrano has also been an advocate for [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307094344/http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/ Puerto Ricans under FBI prosecution]. In May 2000, he brokered an agreement with then-FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]], then [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] Electoral Commissioner [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Orellana]] and then Puerto Rico Senate Federal Affairs Committee chairman (and future Puerto Rico Senate President and Secretary of State) [[Kenneth McClintock]], that has resulted in the release of nearly 100,000 pages of previously secret FBI files on Puerto Rican political activists.\n\nSerrano was a critic of the Bush administration's approach to handling President [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] of Venezuela. In 2005, while the Venezuelan President was in New York City speaking before the United Nations, the congressman invited him to his district to speak to his constituency.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  After Ch\u00e1vez' death, Serrano published condolences via ''Twitter'' describing him as a leader who \"understood the needs of the poor.
