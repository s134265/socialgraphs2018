Welch opposed the war before it began.\n* Caring for veterans by including the support of their recovery from the effects of war in the military budget.\n* Combating global warming and increasing energy independence.\n* Providing universal health care and affordable prescription drugs to Americans.\n\nOne website that tracks congressional votes, [http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Peter_Welch.htm Ontheissues.org], reported in September 2007 that Welch believes that an abortion decision should be between a woman and her doctor.

There are some folks who believe impeachment is a way to end the war, but my major reservation is that impeachment is one approach guaranteed to solidify Republican opposition.\"\n\nOn impeachment, the ''Vermont Guardian''<ref name=\"Vermont Guardian\"/> quoted Welch as saying \"my hat is off to the citizen activists in Vermont for bringing their case to the legislature; they are representative of the proud tradition we have in Vermont to speaking out. [...] People are expressing broad outrage about this President's handling of the war, his treatment of civil liberties, and the use of bogus intelligence, and there is a lot of common ground here on holding the President and Vice President accountable.

Welch said he supports putting effort into creating energy efficiency and alternative energy sources, which will create more jobs for those in need and will also greatly reduce the cost of energy bills, among other things.\n\nAs of late, Welch has been pushing for Congress to pass legislation allowing Vermont to receive federal funding to repair highways and roads damaged by Tropical Storm Irene. He has joined a coalition of 50 Democratic and Republican House members from states affected by Irene in order to make his case in Congress.
