The New Dem PAC, which has worked to recruit more moderate Democrats as candidates for Congress this year, receives significant funding from the banking industry. (https://newdemocratcoalition-himes.house.gov/about-us/our-agenda).   \nIn May 2018, Himes (a former Goldman Sachs employee and member of the Financial Services Committee) voted with house republicans to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to roll back Obama era protections put in place to prevent another financial meltdown. Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Crapo bill for its primary sponsor, Mike Crapo, a Republican senator from Idaho freed thousands of banks with less than $250 billion in assets from stricter federal oversight. (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155). \nCritics of Himes, who's biggest campaign contributors come from the Securities & Investment and Insurance industries (https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00029070), say his vote guts consumer protections and increases the risk of another financial crisis.  Foreign banks that pose major risks, such as the Trump-friendly Deutsche Bank, will see their United States subsidiaries deregulated.  Himes' district include Greenwich, CT, home to many large Hedge Funds and financial services employees. \n\nOf the 33 House Democrats voting in support of the repeal bill, 27 are members of the New Dems. \nHowever, most democrats and progressives opposed the bill.  Nancy Pelosi said \u201cthe bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited an historic financial meltdown.\u201d  \n\nDespite his vote to roll back provisions of Dodd-Frank, Himes touts his accomplishment in helping draft, pass, and defend Dodd-Frank.  His website states: \n\"When I first took office in 2009, I immediately began working with my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee to write the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as Dodd-Frank. This landmark legislation was crafted amidst the wreckage of a disaster that threw more than eight million people out of work and obliterated nearly $16 trillion in American wealth. This was the most significant overhaul of our nation\u2019s financial regulations in decades. This landmark law put in place tough new rules to protect consumers and monitor irresponsible behavior.\nUnfortunately, we are now forced to defend against multiple efforts undo all of the protections we have instituted. Legislation has passed the House of Representatives to strip power away from the SEC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; make it easier for banks to gamble with taxpayer money by repealing the Volcker Rule; and opens the door for more bailouts. I will continue to fight against these attacks on behalf of American consumers and taxpayers.\"(https://himes.house.gov/financial-services-depth)\n\nAt the bill-signing ceremony, Trump praised democrats' support stating, \u201cDodd-Frank was something they said could not be touched and, honestly, a lot of great Democrats knew that it had to be done,\u201d he said.\n \n\nOn March 6, 2013, Himes co-sponsored H.R. 992 <ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr992ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr992ih.pdf</ref> which rolls back provisions in section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Citigroup's recommendations were reflected in more than 70 lines of the House Financial Services committee's 85-line bill.
