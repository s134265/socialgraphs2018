At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at [[Western Illinois University]] and attended [[Moody Bible Institute]], and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in religious education from [[Taylor University]]. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in [[New Haven, Indiana]], which concluded when he enrolled in the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] graduate school.
