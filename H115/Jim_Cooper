The new 4th ran diagonally across the state, from heavily [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] areas near [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]], [[Knoxville]] and [[Chattanooga]] to the fringes of the Nashville [[suburb]]s. The district stretched across five media markets\u2014the Tri-Cities (Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol), Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and [[Huntsville, Alabama]]\u2014so the 1982 race had much of the feel of a statewide race. Owing to the district's demographics, many felt that whoever won the election would almost instantly become a statewide figure with a high potential for election to statewide office in the future. Cooper defeated Cissy Baker, an editor in Washington for the Cable News Network and the daughter of U.S. Senate Majority Leader [[Howard Baker]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925782,00.html |title=The House: Political Genes and Reaganomics |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 4, 1982}}</ref> with 66 percent of the vote. \n\nCooper was reelected five more times with little substantive opposition, running unopposed in 1986 and 1988. This was somewhat surprising, given the district's volatile demographics. The district was split between areas with strong Democratic and Republican voting histories. Indeed, prior to Cooper's election, much of the eastern portion of the 4th hadn't been represented by a Democrat since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. On paper, the 4th was not safe for either party. In truth, its size made it very difficult to unseat an incumbent.\n\n===Tenure===\nIn 1992 Cooper was co-author of a bipartisan health-care reform plan, that did not include employer mandates compelling [[universal health care|universal coverage]].

Cooper received just under 40 percent of the vote. It was a bad year overall for Democrats in Tennessee, as Republican [[Bill Frist]] captured Tennessee's other Senate seat and [[Don Sundquist]] was elected governor. The 4th district seat was also won by a Republican, [[Van Hilleary]], as the GOP gained a majority of the state's congressional delegation for only the second time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\n==Inter-congressional years (1995\u20132003)==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}\n\nAfter losing his Senate bid, Cooper moved to Nashville and went into private business, also serving as a professor at [[Vanderbilt University]]'s [[Owen Graduate School of Management]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives (2003\u2013present)==\n\n===Elections===\n;2002\nWhen Thompson opted not to run for a second full Senate term in 2002, 5th District Congressman [[Bob Clement]] (with whom Cooper had served from 1988 to 1995) ran for Thompson's seat.

The district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands without interruption since 1875, and the last well-financed Republican bid came in 1972. Cooper thus effectively assured his return to Congress in the Democratic primary. Upon his return to Congress, the Democrats gave him back his seniority.\n\n;2004\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}\n\nCooper was re-elected in 2004 against a Republican who disavowed his party's national ticket.\n\n;2006\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn the 2006 election, Cooper faced Tom Kovach, the state public relations coordinator for the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]], who ran as a Republican since the Constitution Party did not have [[ballot access]] in Tennessee at the time.

This led to speculation that the legislature might try to draw the 5th out from under Cooper. Indeed, in the summer of 2011 Cooper and [[List of mayors of Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville Mayor]] [[Karl Dean]] told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that they'd heard rumors about ashville being split between three Republican districts. Despite its large size, Nashville has been located entirely or mostly in a single district since Reconstruction. Cooper said he'd gotten his hands on a map that would have placed his home in Nashville into the heavily Republican [[Tennessee's 6th congressional district|6th District]]. The 5th would have been reconfigured into a strongly Republican district stretching from [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]] to the Alabama border, while the rest of Nashville would have been placed in the heavily Republican [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th District]]. Had it been implemented, the map would have left Cooper with only two realistic places to run\u2014an incumbent-versus-incumbent challenge in the 6th against freshman Republican [[Diane Black]], or the reconfigured 5th, which had reportedly been drawn for State Senator and Murfreesboro resident [[Bill Ketron]], chairman of the redistricting committee.<ref>Sisk, Chas.
