By recruiting and allowing transgender individuals to serve in our military we are subjecting taxpayers to high medical costs including up to $130,000 per transition surgery, lifetime hormone treatments, and additional surgeries to address the high percentage of individuals who experience complications. Surgeries alone could cost $1.35 billion over the next 10 years. For perspective, examples of other things the DoD could spend $1.35 billion on include 13 F-35's, 14 Super Hornet F-18's, 2 B-21 long-range strike bombers, 8 KC-46's, all A-10 wing replacements or increased end strength of our troops.\n\nThis policy is costly and a threat to our readiness. The deployability of individuals going through the sex transition process is highly problematic, requiring 210 to 238 work days where a soldier is non-deployable after surgery. This recovery time equates to 1.4 million manpower days where transgender personnel cannot deploy and fight our nation's wars, therefore relying on an already stressed force to pick up the burden. It makes no sense to purposely recruit individuals who cannot serve. Transgendered individuals undergoing treatment are not eligible for special duties like flying status, personnel reliability program, and jobs requiring certain Security Clearances.\n\nThis is also an issue of fairness.  Currently we refuse entrance into our armed forces for lesser physical issues, such as flat feet, bunions, asthma, and sleep walking. I had a constituent denied entrance into the JAG program because she had a bunion, yet accession standards are set to be modified to allow transgendered individuals into a military where they will be unable to fully serve. This is a senseless and highly unfair double standard.\n\nMilitary service is a privilege \u2014 not a right \u2014 predicated on the singular goal of fighting and winning our nation's wars. All decisions on personnel and funding should be made with this in mind. High entry and retention standards are required because failure in the job costs lives. Last year's transgender decision is costly in dollars and short on common sense.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hartzler.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/hartzler-statement-ndaa-amendment-reverse-obama-transgender-policy|title=Hartzler Statement on NDAA Amendment to Reverse Obama Transgender Policy|date=June 29, 2017|work=Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler|access-date=July 19, 2017|language=en}}</ref>}}\n\nAlthough her amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 was rejected in a 209-214 vote,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lardner|first1=Richard|title=House rejects attempt to ban transgender surgery for troops|url=https://apnews.com/42543881d87246c0aad086ebade752c5|website=Associated Press|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.Amdt.183 to H.R.2810 in 115th Congress (2017-2018)|url=https://www.congress.gov/amendment/115th-congress/house-amendment/183/actions|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref> and she did not speak with President Trump directly, the president announced via Twitter on July 26, 2017 that he would ban transgender people to serve in U.S. military.
