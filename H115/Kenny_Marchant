The district includes several areas around [[Dallas]] and [[Fort Worth]].\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nMarchant was born in [[Bonham, Texas|Bonham]], [[Texas]], but grew up in [[Carrollton, Texas|Carrollton]], a Dallas suburb. He graduated from [[R.L. Turner High School]] in Carrollton and attended college at [[Southern Nazarene University|Southern Nazarene University (SNU)]] in [[Bethany, Oklahoma|Bethany]], [[Oklahoma]], at which he graduated with a [[Business Administration]] degree. He worked as a [[real estate developer]] and he owned a home-building company prior to entering politics.\n\nMarchant served on the Carrollton City Council from 1980 to 1984, and was [[mayor]] of Carrollton from 1984 to 1986, both [[nonpartisan]] positions.\n\n==Texas House of Representatives==\nHe was a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from 1987 to 2004. During three of his nine terms in the Texas House, Marchant served as chairman of the Committee on Financial Institutions. He pushed for legislation that reorganized the Texas Banking Code. In 2002, he was chosen as Chairman of the Texas House Republican Caucus.

However, he has occasionally broken ranks with the GOP, as he did to increase the [[minimum wage]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-mckenzie_20edi.ART.State.Edition1.379bba4.html Works well with others?

The [[Sunlight Foundation]] wrote that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, Marchant has the fifth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog \u2013 Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|date=August 8, 2008 |url= http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}} Retrieved on July 25, 2016</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nMarchant had planned to run for Congress two years earlier in a bid to represent the newly created {{ushr|Texas|32|32nd district}} in suburban Dallas, but fellow Republican [[Pete Sessions]], an incumbent, chose to run there instead. During the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Marchant, in his position on the Texas House's Redistricting Committee, was ideally positioned to help draw Texas districts.  As part of this effort, the 24th District, represented by 13-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Martin Frost]], was reconfigured from a heavily Democratic district with a sizable Latino population into a heavily Republican district that was over 73 percent white.  While [[Al Gore]] easily carried the old 24th in the 2000 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] would have won the new 24th with a staggering 68 percent of the vote.  Marchant was elected to Congress in 2004, and was reelected in 2006 (with 60% of the ballots cast) and 2008 (with 56% of the ballots cast).\n\nMarchant won his seventh term in the House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 154,845 votes (56.2 percent), he defeated the Democrat Jan McDowell, who received 108,389 (39.3 percent). Two other candidates held the remaining 4.5 percent of the ballots cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist319_state.htm|title=Election Results|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMarchant is married to Donna Marchant and has four children as well as four grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Kenny|url=http://marchant.house.gov/biography/}}</ref> They live in [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], a Dallas suburb.\nMarchant's son [[Matthew Marchant]] is a former mayor of [[Carrollton, Texas]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portalbar|Dallas|Texas|Politics|Christianity}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marchant.house.gov/ Congressman Kenny Marchant] official U.S. House site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090214040753/http://www.kennyforcongress.com/ Kenny Marchant for Congress]\n* {{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Texas/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Kenny_Marchant_%5BR-24%5D}}\n* {{C-SPAN|Kenny Marchant}}\n* {{CongLinks | congbio=m001158 | votesmart=5549 | fec=H4TX24094 | congress=kenny-marchant/1806 }}<!--\nLinks formerly displayed via the CongLinks template:\n* [http://ballotpedia.org/Kenny_Marchant Biography] at [[Ballotpedia]]\n* [http://www.nndb.com/people/221/000086960 Biography] at [[NNDB]]\n* [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/400656 Congressional profile] at [[GovTrack]]\n* [http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/400656 Congressional profile] at [[Participatory Politics Foundation|OpenCongress]]\n* [http://www.rollcall.com/members/18463.html Congressional profile] at ''[[Roll Call]]''\n* [http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00026710 Financial information (federal office)] at [[Center for Responsive Politics|OpenSecrets.org]]\n* [http://apps.washingtonpost.com/politics/capitol-assets/member/kenny-marchant Financial investments (personal)] at ''[[The Washington Post]]''\n* [http://www.legistorm.com/member/350/Rep_Kenny_Marchant_TX.html Staff salaries, trips and personal finance] at LegiStorm.com\n* [http://www.followthemoney.org/database/uniquecandidate.phtml?uc=16639 Financial information (state office)] at the National Institute for Money in State Politics\n* [http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Kenny_Marchant.htm Issue positions and quotes] at [[On the Issues]]\n* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/person/1013059 Appearances] on [[C-SPAN]] programs\n* [http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gIQAZ91QKP_topic.html Collected news and commentary] at ''[[The Washington Post]]''\n* -->\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Martin Frost]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the [[List of United States Representatives from Texas|U.S. House of Representatives]]<br>from [[Texas's 24th congressional district]]|years=2005\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Dan Lipinski]]<br>D-[[Illinois]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]|years=122nd}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Michael McCaul]]<br>R-[[Texas]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{TX-FedRep}}\n{{USHouseCurrent}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marchant, Kenny}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:American members of the Church of the Nazarene]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Mayors of places in Texas]]\n[[Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Bonham, Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Carrollton, Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Coppell, Texas]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Southern Nazarene University alumni]]\n[[Category:Tea Party movement activists]]\n[[Category:Texas city council members]]\n[[Category:Texas Republicans]]\n[[Category:Activists from Texas]]\n[[Category:21st-century American politicians]]"}]}}}}
