He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Turner's district, numbered as the 3rd District from 2003 to 2013, is based in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] and consists of Montgomery, Greene and Fayette counties.\n\nTurner also previously served as the president of the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://turner.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/turner-chosen-to-lead-nato-parliamentary-assembly |title= Turner Chosen to Lead NATO Parliamentary Assembly |publisher=Turner.house.gov |date=Dec 3, 2014 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> from 2014 to 2016.\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nTurner, a non-denominational [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]], was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1960 to Vivian and Ray Turner. His mother was a teacher in the Wayne School system in Huber Heights and his father worked as a member of IUE Local 801 for 42 years after serving in the military. Turner was raised in East Dayton and has one sister.\n\nTurner graduated from Belmont High School in 1978 and received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[political science]] from the [[Ohio Northern University]] in 1982, a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Case Western Reserve University]]  in 1985, and an [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] from the [[University of Dayton]] in 1992. He practiced law with local firms and businesses in the Dayton area before entering politics. He also practiced law during the brief time between his service as Mayor of Dayton and as a Member of Congress.\n\n==Mayor of Dayton==\nTurner was elected Mayor of [[Dayton, Ohio]] in 1993, narrowly defeating incumbent Mayor Richard Clay Dixon.  Prior to Mayor-Elect Turner taking office, the city suffered a number of economic setbacks. Upon taking office, Turner focused on attracting business to the city and on redeveloping vacant and underutilized real estate packages known as [[brownfields]].\n\nDuring Turner\u2019s time as [[list of mayors of Dayton, Ohio|mayor of Dayton]], the city reached an agreement to construct a baseball stadium for a class A minor league team affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nTurner was the mayor of Dayton during the planning and construction of the [[Schuster Center]], which he supported for its contribution to reviving downtown. He facilitated discussions with key leaders from the project\u2019s conception to its completion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vote-usa.org/Intro.aspx?State=OH&Id=OHTurnerMichaelR |title=Michael R. \"Mike\" Turner, Currently Elected Ohio U.S. Representative District 3 |publisher=Vote-usa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The [[Schuster Center]] is a performing arts center located at the corner of Second and Main Streets in downtown Dayton. The Center has served as a forum for the Victoria Theatre\u2019s Broadway Series, the [[Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Dayton Ballet]], and also as a speaking location for visiting political leaders, such as former New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]].\n\nTurner also started a program called \"Rehabarama\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/10/29/ddn103007census.html |title=Dayton, Ohio, news and information |publisher=DaytonDailyNews |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> which attracted professionals to historic properties inside the city. Mayor Turner welcomed diplomats and leaders from all over the world to the region as part of the 1995 [[Dayton Peace Accords]].\n\nHe was reelected in 1997 over Democratic City Commissioner [[Tony Capizzi]]. He continued efforts to develop the economy of both the city and the surrounding region. Turner was narrowly defeated in 2001 by then-State Senator [[Rhine McLin]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\nTurner is currently a member of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] and [[United States House Committee on Government Reform|Government Reform]] committees. In 2009, he was named Ranking Member on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services]].\n\n===108th Congress===\nIn November 2002, Turner was elected to Congress, succeeding Democrat [[Tony Patrick Hall]], who had been appointed by President Bush to the UN. After taking office, in January 2003 Turner was appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]], a position he has used to advocate for [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] located in his district, and to the [[United States House Committee on Government Reform|Government Reform Committee]].\n\nDue to his urban background, focus on the economic redevelopment of cities, and service as Dayton\u2019s mayor, Turner is sometimes described as an \"urban Republican\". Recognizing Turner's work on urban development, then-House Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]] appointed Turner as Chairman of the Saving America\u2019s Cities working group. The group was formed to work with the Administration to \"foster economic development and redevelopment and streamline government services in America's cities to help them prosper and grow.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmayors.org/usmayornewspaper/documents/02_09_04/hastert.asp |title=Speaker Hastert Calls for Open Lines of Communication with Mayors |publisher=US Conference of Mayors |date=2004-02-09 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404115336/http://www.usmayors.org/usmayornewspaper/documents/02_09_04/hastert.asp |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===109th Congress===\nDuring the 109th Congress, Turner served on the [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee]], in addition to his work on his two other committees, the House Armed Services and Government Reform Committees.\n\n===110th Congress===\nServing on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]], Turner had advocated for an expansion to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], providing testimony to the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] (BRAC). This effort proved successful in 2008, when the Air Force announced that 1,000 jobs and over $230 million in federal funding would move to Wright-Patterson AFB.

Hall]] from Congress after Hall was named U. N. Special Envoy for Hunger Issues by President [[George W. Bush]]. Earlier that year, Turner won the Republican nomination when he decisively defeated Roy Brown with 80% of the vote in a heavily contested primary. Brown was the son and grandson of a former area Republican Congressmen [[Bud Brown (politician)|Bud Brown]] and [[Clarence J. Brown]] and operated a local newspaper company named Brown Publishing. Despite this, Turner still won the contest decisively. In the general election, Turner defeated Congressman Tony Hall\u2019s chief of staff, Rick Carne, after Carne won the nomination to succeed his former boss.  Turner got a substantial assist from the 2000s round of redistricting.  The old 7th had been a fairly compact district centered on Dayton.  However, redistricting added some Republican-leaning suburbs to the east.\n\n===2004===\nIn [[United States House elections, 2004|2004]], Turner defeated former businesswoman Jane Mitakides with over 62% of the vote. The district was considered a key area in the swing state of Ohio in that year\u2019s presidential race. Turner ran on his record of advocacy for [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] and on the importance of his seat on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]].\n\n===2006===\nIn [[United States House elections, 2006|2006]], the Democrats planned to target Turner for defeat. Three Democrats entered the Third District Primary to run against Turner in the general election. [[Veterinarian]] [[Stephanie Studebaker]] defeated local bankruptcy attorney David Fierst and recalled Waynesville Mayor Charles W. Sanders. Studebaker had previously affiliated with former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean|Howard Dean\u2019s]] Presidential campaign in Ohio during the 2004 race.

Following Studebaker\u2019s withdrawal, four Democrats entered a special election primary to face Turner, eventually settling on former Assistant [[United States Attorney]] Richard Chema. Turner defeated Chema with 58% of the vote.\n\n===2008===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2008#District 3}}\nJane Mitakides beat Sanders in a primary in 2008 and faced Turner in a rematch from 2004. Turner again focused largely on economic issues of job creation and protection for workers impacted by the national and regional recession. In a difficult political climate for Republicans, Turner defeated Mitakides with 64% of the vote, his largest margin of victory in any election.\n\n===2010===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2010#District 3}}\nTurner was challenged by Democratic nominee Joe Roberts in the general election and won with 68 percent of the vote.\n\n===2012===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 10}}\nAfter redistricting, Turner's district was renumbered as the [[Ohio's 10th congressional district|10th district]].
