The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home.

The 20th is so heavily Democratic that Hostetter faced nearly impossible odds in November. However, she gained notoriety for her attacks on Wasserman Schultz.  For example, Hostetter's campaign site criticized Wasserman Schultz for protesting an [[American flag]] photograph with a [[Christian cross]] on it that was on display in the workstation of a secretary in a government building. Hostetter wrote, \"Elect Margaret Hostetter to Congress November 2 and send the clear message that Americans respect and support... the foundational role [[Christianity]] has had in the formation of our great nation. Our rights come from [[God]], not the state.\" {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWasserman Schultz won, taking 70.2% to Hostetter's 29.8%.

When Wasserman Schultz was sworn in on January 4, 2005, she chose to use the Hebrew Bible, or [[Tanakh]].
