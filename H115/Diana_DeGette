Bush]]'s limits on federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]]. DeGette, who had been working on the measure since 2001, enlisted the support of Representative [[Michael N. Castle]] (Republican from Delaware), who became DeGette's principal Republican cosponsor of the legislation. The [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005|DeGette-Castle bill]] passed the Senate on July 18, 2006.

The Senate adopted a different version of the legislation the next day.\n\nDeGette was also a cosponsor for the Udall Amendment to the House Energy Bill, which the House approved by a vote of 220 to 190 on August 4, 2007.
