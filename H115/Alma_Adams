She is from Greensboro, but the bulk of the district's population is in Charlotte. The three Charlotteans in the race split that region's vote; and Adams won both primaries with approximately 44 percent of the vote, a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a [[two-round system|runoff]]. She faced Republican Vince Coakley, a former television and radio broadcaster from Matthews, in both the general and special elections, which were held on the same day in November. The 12th was a heavily Democratic district with a majority-black voting population and a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+26, and Adams was overwhelmingly favored in the general election. She won both handily.\n\nAdams is the second woman of color to represent North Carolina in the House. The first was [[Eva Clayton]], who represented much of eastern North Carolina from 1992 to 2002.\n\nIn the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], Adams endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] and pledged her support as a [[superdelegate]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|title=The 2016 Endorsement Primary|url=http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/|accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdams decided not to attend the January 2017 [[Inauguration of Donald Trump]].\n\n====Adams' residency questioned====\n\nA court-ordered redistricting in 2016 made the 12th somewhat more compact.  It now comprised nearly all of [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]], home to Charlotte.  Adams' home in Greensboro was drawn into the 13th district.  Adams had already filed for a second full term, but announced she would move to Charlotte.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article65183332.html|title=Rep.
