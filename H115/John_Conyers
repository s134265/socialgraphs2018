He also served as an aide to Congressman [[John Dingell]] before winning [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1964|election to the House in 1964]]. He co-founded the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] in 1969 and established a reputation as one of the most [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] members of Congress. Conyers joined the liberal [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] after it was founded in 1991. Conyers supports the creation of a [[single-payer healthcare]] system and sponsored the [[United States National Health Care Act]] to achieve that goal.

Conyers ran for Mayor of Detroit in 1989 and 1993 but was defeated in the primary in both elections.\n\nConyers served as the [[Ranking member|ranking Democratic member]] on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] from 1995 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2017.

He was reelected 13 times with even larger margins. After the [[1990 United States Census]], Michigan lost a congressional district and Conyers's district was renumbered to the [[Michigan's 14th congressional district|14th district]]. In 1992, he won re-election to his 15th term in his new district with 82% of the vote against Republican nominee John Gordon. He won re-election another nine times after that. His worst re-election performance was in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010]], when he got 77% of the vote against Republican nominee Don Ukrainec. In 2013, his district was renamed to the [[Michigan's 13th congressional district|13th district]].\n\nIn total, he won re-election twenty-five times and was serving in his twenty-sixth term.

He served longer in Congress than any other African American. In 1971, he was one of the original members of [[Nixon's Enemies List]].\n\nIn 1965 Conyers won a seat as a freshman on the influential [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], which was then under the leadership of Democratic Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]] of New York.

[[Civil Rights Movement]] icon [[Rosa Parks]] served on Conyers' staff between 1965 and 1988.\n\nConyers is known as one of the opponents of the drive to regulate [[online gambling]]. He has likened the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]], hidden within the [[SAFE Port Act]], to Prohibition. After [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s assassination in 1968, Conyers introduced the first bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. It is now celebrated as [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]].\n\nConyers introduced the \"Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act\" ({{USBill|101|HR|3745}}) in January 1989, and has re-introduced anew this bill each congressional term. This bill calls for the creation of a commission to research the history of [[slavery]] and its effects on current America, resulting in recommendations on how to remedy this injustice.

He was the last remaining member of the House Judiciary Committee who did so.\n\n===National Health Care Act===\nThe [[United States National Health Care Act]] (Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act) (H.R. 676) is a bill submitted to the United States House of Representatives by Conyers which, as of 2015, had 49 cosponsors. It was first introduced, with 25 cosponsors, in 2003,<ref>{{USBill|108|HR|676}}</ref> and reintroduced each session since then. The act calls for the creation of a universal [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States, in which the government would provide every resident health care free of charge.  In order to eliminate disparate treatment between richer and poorer Americans, the Act would also prohibit private insurers from covering any treatment or procedure already covered by the Act.\n\n===Downing Street memo===\nOn May 5, 2005, Conyers and 88 other members of Congress wrote an open letter to the White House inquiring about the [[Downing Street memo]], a leaked memorandum that revealed an apparent secret agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|attack Iraq]] in 2002. ''[[The Times]]'' reported that newly discovered documents reveal British and U.S. intentions to invade Iraq and leaders of the two countries had \"discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so.\" The documents go on to say that [[Tony Blair]] decided the United States would need to \"create\" conditions to justify the war.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe memo story broke in the United Kingdom, but did not receive much coverage in the United States, prompting Conyers to lament: \"This should not be allowed to fall down the memory hole during wall-to-wall coverage of the [[People v.

The evidence offered consists of statistical abnormalities in the differences between [[exit poll]] results and actual votes registered at those locations. The book also discusses reports of faulty [[electronic voting]] machines and the lack of credibility of those machines used to tally votes.\n\nConyers was one of 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|date=January 6, 2005|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7|publisher=clerk.house.gov|access-date=February 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===The Constitution in Crisis===\n{{see also|Lead-up to the Iraq War|Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq}}\n[[File:NLN John Conyers.jpg|thumb|Conyers at an [[Protests against the Iraq War|anti-war march]] in Newark, New Jersey, 2007]]\nOn August 4, 2006, Conyers released his report, ''The Constitution in Crisis: The Downing Street Minutes and Deception, Manipulation, Torture, Retributions and Cover-ups in the Iraq War,'' an edited collection of information intended to serve as evidence that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] altered [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] to justify the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n\n''The Constitution in Crisis'' examines much of the evidence presented by the Bush Administration prior to the invasion and questions the credibility of their sources of intelligence. In addition, the document investigates the conditions that led to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture scandal]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq, as well as further evidence of [[torture]] having been committed but not made known to the public. Finally, the document reports on a series of \"smear tactics\" purportedly used by the administration in dealing with its political adversaries.\n\nThe document calls for the [[censure]] of President [[George W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. Notably, however, Conyers refused to back [[Efforts to impeach George W. Bush|impeachment]] proceedings.\n\n===On anti-Muslim intolerance===\nConyers has proposed [https://web.archive.org/web/20061207142021/http://www.conyersblog.us/archives/00000103.htm House Resolution 288], which condemns \"religious intolerance\" but emphasizes [[Islam]] as needing special protection from acts of violence and intolerance. It states that \"it should never be official policy of the United States Government to disparage the [[Quran]], Islam, or any religion in any way, shape, or form,\" and \"calls upon local, State, and Federal authorities to work to prevent [[hate crime|bias-motivated crimes]] and acts against all individuals, including those of the Islamic faith.\" The bill was referred [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.res.00288: to the House subcommittee on the Constitution] in June 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Conyers introduced H. Res. 160, a house resolution that would have condemned the conduct of [[Narendra Modi]], then the [[Chief Minister of Gujarat|chief minister]] of the [[State of Gujarat]] in [[India]]. The resolution was cosponsored by Republican Representative [[Joseph R. Pitts]] (Republican of Pennsylvania).
