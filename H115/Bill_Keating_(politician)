He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] representing the state's [[Massachusetts's 9th congressional district|9th district]] which includes [[Cape Cod]] and the [[South Coast (Massachusetts)|South Coast]]. Keating raised his profile advocating for criminal justice issues in the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]] before becoming [[district attorney]] (DA) of [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], where he served three terms prior to his election to Congress.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Sharon, Massachusetts]], Keating \"took a traditional route to politics,\"<ref name=\"globe-player\" /> attending [[Boston College]] and [[Suffolk University Law School]]. As a resident of [[Sharon, Massachusetts|Sharon]] he was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in 1976 and went on to serve in the state [[Massachusetts Senate|Senate]] from 1985 to 1999. He authored numerous bills signed into law concerning taxation, drug crime, and sentencing reform. His attempted overthrow of Senate President [[William M. Bulger]] in 1994 was a failure but boosted his local name recognition, which contributed to his success in the 1998 election for DA.\n\nKeating followed the path of former Norfolk District Attorney [[Bill Delahunt]] to Congress, winning election in 2010 to represent the [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district|10th district]]. In 2012, after redistricting combined his district with that of fellow incumbent [[Stephen Lynch (politician)|Stephen Lynch]], Keating chose to run in the \"incumbent-free\" 9th district, where he was elected to a second term. As of the [[115th United States Congress|115th Congress]] (2017\u20132018), Keating sits on the House [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Homeland Security Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs Committee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://keating.house.gov/policy-work/committees-and-caucuses |title=Committees and Caucuses |accessdate=2017-02-14 }}</ref> Much of his work has focused on domestic issues central to his district, such as the fishing industry and nuclear safety.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life, education, and law career==\nKeating was born in [[Norwood, Massachusetts]] in 1952 to Anna (Welch) of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]] and William B.

Graduating from [[Sharon High School (Massachusetts)|Sharon High School]], Keating enrolled in [[Boston College]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1974, and his [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1982. In 1985 Keating earned his [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Suffolk University Law School]] and passed the [[Massachusetts Bar Association|bar exam]].

Keating highlighted a range of endorsements from police organizations, and from Delahunt, as evidence of his criminal justice qualifications.
