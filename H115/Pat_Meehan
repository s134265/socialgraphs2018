A year later, he worked on [[Leroy S. Zimmerman|Roy Zimmerman]]'s campaign for [[Pennsylvania Attorney General]]. Meehan went on to serve as Special Counsel to U.S. Senator [[Arlen Specter]]. He was a campaign manager for U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]], Philadelphia D.A. [[Ronald D.

During Meehan's tenure, his staff prosecuted several high-profile cases, including the ''Du Pont Murder Trial'', (a case involving the murder of Olympic wrestler [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|David Schultz]] by his millionaire benefactor [[John Eleuth\u00e8re du Pont]]) and the 1996 murder of a 22-year-old college student named [[Aimee Willard]] (who was abducted from [[Interstate 476|Route 476]] and found in an abandoned lot in [[North Philadelphia]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile serving as District Attorney, Meehan set up the ''Special Victims Unit for Domestic Violence'' in Delaware County, offering victims protection from their alleged abusers by allowing the prosecution to occur without the victims testifying in open court.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Danielle|title=Meehan, Badey square off in 7th Congressional District race|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20121028/NEWS/310289970|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=Daily Times News|date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> As D.A., he also focused on protecting youth by expanding the ''Youth Aid Panel'' program for first time offenders and creating a truancy project to limit youth-related crime during the day. Meehan established the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s ''Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force'' (ICAC) in Pennsylvania. The ICAC is a special unit of detectives who investigate online predators on the web and bring them to justice; it has become a model across the country.\n\n==U.S. Attorney (2001\u20132008)==\nMeehan became the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 17, 2001, six days after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. He was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] and confirmed by the United States Senate. Meehan headed an office of over 200 lawyers and staff backed up by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Office. As U.S. Attorney, Meehan made terrorism, gang-related crime, child internet safety, and public corruption priorities for his criminal division. Public corruption in Philadelphia in particular was brought to the spotlight in 2003 when a FBI electronic listening device was found in the Philadelphia Mayor's office.\n\nIn light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Meehan formed the Anti-Terrorism Task Force (ATTF), later renamed the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council (ATAC) in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to evaluate and prevent future terrorist attacks. This initiative was done in partnership with local, state and federal law enforcement and emergency responders. The ATAC has led large-scale exercises on biological attacks and the poisoning of the food supply in partnership with Saint Joseph's University in order to help Eastern Pennsylvania prepare for terrorist attacks.<ref name=\"usdoj.gov\">{{cite web |title= U.S. Attorney Patrick L.

The unique \"Route 222 Corridor Anti-Gang Initiative\" brought together elected officials and law enforcement personnel with community groups to fight gangs in a rural area unfamiliar with big-city gang violence. The money was divided among enforcement, prevention and rehabilitation. The program aimed not only to increase arrests, but also to fund school programs and community centers to educate youth about alternatives to gang life.<ref name=\"usdoj.gov\"/>\n\nContinuing the work he began while he was Delaware County D.A., Meehan made child safety on the internet a priority, sponsoring internet safety training seminars with Web Wise Kids and visiting local schools. Meehan's office prosecuted substandard nursing homes and elder care facilities, and nefarious lenders who offered ill-advised loans to disadvantaged homeowners. The U.S. Attorney's Office under Meehan was nationally recognized for its work in the field of health-care fraud. The office won more than half a billion dollars in settlements against some of the largest pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers, ensuring better self-policing and oversight by the industry.<ref>{{cite news |first=J.F. |last=Pirro |title=Justice Served (Straight Up) |newspaper=Mainline Today |date=July 11, 2007 |url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=B5549CFD24E64BAC93E11938AD51A18C&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=1AED076692D1474F883AE0D030F88D25&AudID=18572880BDE043E69679E179E578B1AC }}{{dead link |date=May 2017 |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe announced on July 16, 2008 that he was joining the Philadelphia law firm of Conrad O'Brien Gellman & Rohn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080707_U_S__Attorney_Pat_Meehan_to_step_down.html|title=U.S. Attorney Pat Meehan to step down|last=Lounsberry|first=Emilie|date=July 7, 2008|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=July 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Public corruption cases===\nThough he has been active in a wide variety of areas, it has been several high-profile public corruption cases that have put Meehan in the headlines.
