Steve Scalise (R-LA).<ref name=\"clickondetroit.com\">Meloni, Rod; Rep. Jack Bergman describes shooting at baseball practice: 'I just basically went into a low crawl'; ClickOnDetroit; June 14, 2017; https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/rep-jack-bergman-describes-shooting-at-baseball-practice-i-just-basically-went-into-a-low-crawl</ref>\n\nBergman \"was about to take the batter's box when he heard the first shot.\" Not knowing how many shooters there were, \"I just basically went into a low crawl and crawled behind the first base dugout and listened... It appeared as though the shooter was moving around the outside of the perimeter moving towards the backstop, so once that was the situation then I along with a couple of other folks who were behind the dugout crawled around and went down into the dugout in case the shooter came all around behind the backstop.\"<ref name=\"clickondetroit.com\"/>\n\nAfterwards, Bergman blamed the incident on anti-GOP rhetoric. \"The hateful rhetoric serves no positive purpose, in fact today it obviously served a negative purpose, but unfortunately, and I'm looking at all the media in the eye when I say this: Friendships and cordial relationships don't make good news,\" Bergman said. \"So, I can tell you, especially as president of the freshman class of Republicans, we are united along with our Democratic freshman counterparts to bring civility back to the 115th Congress.\" Asked if he was blaming the media, Bergman said, \"I think the media is complicit if they keep inciting as opposed to informing.\"<ref>Trunko, Matthew; Rep.

In the context of health care, that means coverage should be available to Representatives and our staffs on the same basis that it's available to our constituents.\"<ref>Bergman cosponsors bill to eliminate health care exemptions for members of congress; May 2, 2017; Upper Michigan Source; http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/content/news/Bergman-cosponsors-bill-to-eliminate-health-care-exemptions-for-members-of-congress-421048983.html</ref>\n\n;Environment\nIn September 2017, Bergman became the 29th Republican to join the Climate Solutions Caucus, after having had several friendly meetings with members of the Citizens Climate Lobby who attend high school in his district. At a June meeting with them, he had committed to joining the caucus, and also asked the students to prepare \"a formal presentation on Carbon Fee and Dividend and pitch it to him back at home like a business proposal\" in August. According to the CCL, Bergman \"was particularly interested in the potential job growth Carbon Fee and Dividend would likely bring to the health sector.\" <ref>Winchester, Flannery; Rep.

There are a lot of people who really think they are making good decisions as it relates to the military who have no clue what the ramifications of that decision are because they have never been part of it.\"\n\nBergman sided with President Trump that transgender individuals should be barred from the military. \"The U.S. military is not a social experiment,\" he said. He added: \"I do not support elective surgery of any kind, zero federal dollars spent on elective surgery. I'm all about readiness and winning the fight. Anything that challenges unit cohesion is counterproductive and people get hurt.\"<ref>Magid, Aaron; Meet Jack Bergman: The Former Pilot Now in Congress; Jewish Insider; August 8, 2017; http://jewishinsider.com/12526/meet-jack-bergman-former-pilot-now-congress/</ref>\n\n;Party identity\nHe considers himself a conservative but does not feel strongly about party. \"As a senior military officer, I could not be part of a political party,\" he has said. \"[S]wearing that oath to the Constitution, and being in uniform, we represent everyone, not just some.\"<ref>Hunter, Wil; Meet Republican congressional candidate Jack Bergman; Up Matters; http://www.upmatters.com/news/local-news/meet-republican-congressional-candidate-jack-bergman/461595749</ref>\n\n== Awards and decorations ==\nBergman's military awards include:\n\n=== Medals and ribbons ===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Naval Aviator Badge.jpg|200px]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge.png|175px]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Navy_Distinguished_Service_ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Defense Meritorious Service ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Air Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}<span style=\"position:relative; top:0; left:-63px; display:inline-block; width:0;\">[[File:Combat Distinguishing Device.svg|21px]]</span><span style=\"position:relative; top:0; left:-31px; display:inline-block; width:0;\">[[File:Award numeral 1.png|21px]]</span>\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Joint Meritorious Unit Award-3d.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy Unit Commendation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=5|type=service-star|ribbon=Selected Marine Corps Reserve ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=3|type=service-star|ribbon=Vietnam Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Global War on Terrorism Service ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=AFRM_with_Hourglass_Device_%28Gold%29.jpg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Cross_of_Gallantry_with_Bronze_Star_%28South_Vietnam%29.png|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Vietnam gallantry cross unit award-3d.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=VNCivilActionsRibbon-2.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Vietnam Campaign Medal ribbon with 60- clasp.svg|width=106}}\n|} </center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[United States Aviator Badge|Naval Aviator Badge]]\n|rowspan=\"5\" align=center\" |[[Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Distinguished Service Medal (US Navy)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Valor Awards for John W.
