The district is based in the state capital, [[Hartford]]. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  Larson is the former chairman of the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|House Democratic Caucus]].\n\n==Early life, education, and teaching/business career==\nLarson was born in Hartford, but has spent most of his life in nearby [[East Hartford]]. He grew up in a public housing project. He was educated at [[East Hartford High School]] and [[Central Connecticut State University]]. He worked as a high school history teacher and an assistant athletics coach at George J. Penney High School (later Penney High merged with [[East Hartford High School]]).\n\nLarson was also the co-owner of an insurance agency in East Hartford before entering public service. In 1971, he was selected as a Senior Fellow to the [[Yale University]] Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy by the [[Head Start Program]] founder, [[Edward Zigler]].\n\n==Early political career==\nLarson began his political career in 1977, when he served one term on the East Hartford Board of Education.  He then served two terms on the East Hartford Town Council.\n\nIn 1982, Larson was elected to the [[Connecticut Senate]] from the 3rd district, based in East Hartford. He served six terms in that body, the last four as [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1994, Larson left the state senate and sought the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of Connecticut]] but was defeated by [[Bill Curry (politician)|Bill Curry]] in the primary. After being defeated for governor, Larson entered private business for several years but was able to maintain his political credentials.\n\nDue in part to service in the Democratic Party and his local connections in the state, he narrowly defeated Secretary of State Miles Rappaport in the Democratic primary for the 1st District when 17-year incumbent [[Barbara Kennelly]] gave up the seat to run for governor in 1998. This was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. He has been re-elected six times with no substantive opposition.\n\nOn February 1, 2006, Larson was elected [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Vice Chair]] of the House Democratic Caucus.  The previous vice chairman, [[Jim Clyburn]], moved up to chairman when [[Bob Menendez]] was appointed to the [[United States Senate]]. After the Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections, Larson opted not to run for caucus chairman\u2014a post that went to former [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]], instead running unopposed for re-election as vice chairman.\n\nAfter being re-elected in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Connecticut, 2008|2008]], Larson was elected chairman of the Caucus for the [[111th Congress]], after Emanuel was named [[White House Chief of Staff]].<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Pelosi-Announces-New-Majority-Leadership/story.aspx?guid=%7B0DA02185-7799-439D-87B1-598CCF9C19BE%7D Pelosi Announces New Majority Leadership Team], marketwatch.com; accessed November 1, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\n\n====Energy and the Environment====\nLarson has introduced various pieces of legislation in attempts to nationalize the US's energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect the environment.

Larson was a strong advocate for the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], which increased federal spending in infrastructure, education, health and energy while expanding some welfare and social security programs.
