He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is part of the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] of [[Southern California]].\n\n==Early life, education, and business career==\nCalvert was born in [[Corona, California]], to Marceline Hamblen and Ira D. Calvert, Jr.,<ref>{{cite web |title=Kenneth Stanton \"Ken\" Calvert |publisher=RootsWeb |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/calvert.htm}}</ref> and still lives in Corona. In 1970, shortly after high school, he joined the campaigns of former state legislator [[Victor Veysey]]. Calvert worked in Veysey's Washington, D.C., office as an intern after a 1972 victory. He graduated from [[Corona High School]] in 1971.\n\nCalvert received an [[Associate of Arts]] degree from [[Chaffey College|Chaffey Community College]] in 1973 and a Bachelor of Arts degree [[San Diego State University]] in 1975. After graduation, he managed his family's restaurant, the Jolly Fox, in Corona for five years. He then entered the real estate industry and ran Ken Calvert Real Properties until he was elected to Congress.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1982, the 29-year-old Calvert ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] to represent a newly drawn district. He narrowly lost the Republican primary to Riverside County Supervisor [[Al McCandless]], who had been the choice of the Republican establishment. McCandless went on to win the general election.\n\nCalvert was first elected to the House in 1992, when McCandless was re-elected in a different district. Calvert won the general election with 47% of the vote (a plurality, but he was the highest vote-getter), defeating Democrat [[Mark Takano]] by 519 votes. In 1994, he was challenged in the Republican primary by Joe Khoury and won renomination by only 51% to 49%. He was re-elected in the 1994 general election with 55 percent, again defeating Takano. Ironically, he now serves in the House alongside his former opponent; Takano was elected to Congress in an adjacent district in 2012.\n\nIn 1996, he was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Guy Kimbrough. In 1998 he defeated Democrat Mike Rayburn with 55 percent of the vote. Calvert won again in 2000 with 74 percent of the vote, facing no major-party opposition.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nCalvert was re-elected in 2002, defeating Louis Vandenberg with 64 percent of the vote. He defeated Vandenberg again in 2004 with 61 percent of the vote. Vandenberg, a college administrator, was again Calvert's opponent in the November 2006 election.[http://www.vandenbergforcongress.com/] Calvert won with 60 percent of the vote; Vandenburg got 38 percent.<ref>California Secretary of State, [http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/4400.htm 2006 general election results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611145319/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/4400.htm |date=June 11, 2007 }}, U.S. Congress District 44.
