This has nothing to do with drought.\"<ref name=\"Onishi\" /> Nunes elaborated on his beliefs in an April 2015 ''[[National Review]]'' article. At the time, California farmers were criticized for their water usage and accused of making the state's drought worse: the agriculture sector uses at least 80 percent of the state's water, often on water-intensive crops such as almonds. Nunes, a third-generation dairy farmer, challenged media criticism of the agriculture industry: \"Farmers do not use 80 percent of California's water. In reality, 50 percent of the water that is captured by the state's dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and other infrastructure is diverted for environmental causes. Farmers, in fact, use 40 percent of the water supply. Environmentalists have manufactured the 80 percent statistic by deliberately excluding environmental diversions from their calculations.\"<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\" /> Nunes added that California's lack of adequate water storage facilities had only made the problem worse: \"Furthermore, in many years there are additional millions of acre-feet of water that are simply flushed into the ocean due to a lack of storage capacity&nbsp;\u2014 a situation partly explained by environmental groups' opposition to new water-storage projects\".<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\" /> Returning to an argument he has made before regarding California's water storage and irrigation system, Nunes added, \"The drought is a genuine problem in California, but our irrigation system was designed to withstand five years of drought.\"<ref name=\"nationalreview.com\" />\n\nOn May 1, 2011, with the support of other members of the San Joaquin Valley's Republican congressional delegation, Nunes authored the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act]] to stop a project designed to restore a dried-up section of the [[San Joaquin River]]. This later became the basis for another bill Nunes co-sponsored, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act, which passed the House of Representatives in February 2014, but was not voted on by the Senate. Nunes also co-sponsored the California Emergency Drought Relief Act, which passed the House of Representatives in December 2014 but was also not voted on by the Senate. Water restrictions have been in place to enforce the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] and other environmental regulations that have seen water allocations decline dramatically even in non-drought years. The result has been what Nunes terms a \"man-made drought\".<ref>http://www.kmjnow.com/pages/landing_news?Valley-GOP-Reps-Introduce-Water-Legislat=1&blockID=520842&feedID=806 {{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref> Nunes wrote in ''[[National Review]]'' in April 2015, \"The House of Representatives has passed three bills in the last three years that would have expanded California water supplies by rolling back damaging environmental regulations.
