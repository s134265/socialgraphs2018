As a young man, DeSaulnier worked as a probation officer, a truck driver and a hotel services employee.{{cn|date=July 2018}}  \n\nDeSaulnier was a member of both the Teamsters International Union and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. His jobs allowed his early exposure to the challenges of working families and the power of organized labor to create equity among employers and employees. A small businessman, DeSaulnier owned and operated several restaurants in the greater Bay Area before taking office in the Legislature in 2006.{{cn|date=July 2018}}  \n\n==Personal life==\nA member of the Concord Chamber of Commerce and the Contra Costa Council, DeSaulnier lives in [[Concord, California]], where he raised his two sons.

In September 1998, for example, he donated $200.00 to the United Republican Finance Committee of the Contra Costa County Republican Central Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?99034200516|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2009-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502132810/http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?99034200516|archivedate=May 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring DeSaulnier's tenure on the Board of Supervisors, he sponsored the Industrial Safety Ordinance and the Refinery Flare Rule for local refineries and chemical facilities. DeSaulnier served on the executive boards of the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. He was appointed to represent the Bay Area on the California Air Resources Board by the Air District (1997\u20132006).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAs a member of the Air Resources Board, DeSaulnier supported strong environmental regulations, including cleaner-burning gasoline, lower-emission vehicles (LEVs), the identification of diesel exhaust as a toxic air contaminant, dioxin monitoring in the Bay Area, the banning of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline, the identification of secondhand smoke as a carcinogen, the reduction of emissions from dairy farms, the phase-out of rice straw in the central valley and the reduction of emissions from cruise ships.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn a county level, DeSaulnier introduced a Women's Health Program to serve the health-care needs of all women in Contra Costa County.  He also established the annual Children and Families' Budget, a separate County budget that reviews and measures the effectiveness of County programs in these areas. His other projects for children include AfterSchool4All, the Future Fund and the Children and Families Committee of the Board of Supervisors.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[Contra Costa Times]] editorial board was critical of DeSaulnier's record as county supervisor.  An editorial published in 2009 stated, \"Many of the financial problems that afflict Contra Costa County today stem directly from decisions DeSaulnier championed while he was supervisor. Most notably, in 2002, at a time when the county faced a $31.5 million shortfall, was already laying off workers and was already experiencing increased public employee pension costs, DeSaulnier supported unsustainable pension increases that hiked benefits for public safety workers by as much as 50 percent. The plan allowed public safety workers to retire at age 50 with a pension worth 3 percent of their salary for each year served. Such excessive public employee union benefits have strained some local jurisdictions to the brink of bankruptcy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/opinion/ci_13193307|title=Editorial: John Garamendi is our recommended choice for the 10th Congressional District|date=August 24, 2009|website=Contracostatimes.com|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==California State Assembly==\nIn the June 2006 Democratic primary, DeSaulnier carried 52 percent of the vote against Laura Canciamilla and two other opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primary2006.sos.ca.gov/Returns/stasm/1100.htm|title=CA Secretary of State \u2013 Primary Election- State Assembly District 11 \u2013 Districtwide|publisher=sos.ca.gov|accessdate=February 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207114049/http://primary2006.sos.ca.gov/Returns/stasm/1100.htm|archivedate=February 7, 2012}}</ref> DeSaulnier was endorsed by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.markdesaulnier.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=131|title=Mark DeSaulnier \u2013 Publication Details|publisher=Cms.markdesaulnier.com|accessdate=February 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023225144/http://cms.markdesaulnier.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=131|archivedate=October 23, 2007}}</ref> U.S. Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] and California Senator [[Tom Torlakson]].
