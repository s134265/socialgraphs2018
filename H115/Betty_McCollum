The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring [[Minneapolis]]-based 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent, State Senator [[Linda Runbeck]], but [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.\n\n==Electoral history==\n\n{{Election box begin | title=2000 Fourth Congressional District of Minnesota Elections}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Democratic Party (US)\n  |candidate  = Betty McCollum\n  |votes      = 130,403\n  |percentage = 48.04%\n  |change     = \u2013}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Republican Party (US)\n  |candidate  = [[Linda Runbeck]]\n  |votes      = 83,852\n  |percentage = 30.89%\n  |change     = \u2013}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence\n  |candidate  = Tom Foley\n  |votes      = 55,899\n  |percentage = 20.59%\n  |change     = \u2013}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Constitution Party (US)|Constitution\n  |candidate  = Nicholas Skrivanek\n  |votes      = 1,285\n  |percentage = 0.47%\n  |change     = \u2013}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Election box begin | title=2002 Fourth Congressional District of Minnesota Elections}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Democratic Party (US)\n  |candidate  = Betty McCollum\n  |votes      = 164,597\n  |percentage = 62.22%\n  |change     = +14.18%}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Republican Party (US)\n  |candidate  = Clyde Billington\n  |votes      = 89,705\n  |percentage = 33.91%\n  |change     = \u2013}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Green Party of the United States|Green\n  |candidate  = Scott J.
