He was responding to concerns from members of the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation]] in eastern Arizona when he made the comment that stunned people at the round-table talk in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The topic had addressed the proposal to swap 2,400 acres of southeastern Arizona's [[Tonto National Forest]] for about 5,300 acres of environmentally sensitive land.  The proposal, which was attached as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to the 2015 [[National Defense Authorization Act]], would give land sacred to the Apache in Arizona to [[Resolution Copper]] Mine, a joint venture owned by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] and [[BHP Billiton]].  [[Troy Eid]], a Republican and former U.S. Attorney in Colorado, responded to Gosar's comments and said: \"In the heated context of what this represents, it's especially inappropriate to be resorting to what amounts to race baiting.\"  A Gosar spokesperson said his comments were misconstrued.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/paul-gosar-native-americans_n_6305738.html |title=Rep.
