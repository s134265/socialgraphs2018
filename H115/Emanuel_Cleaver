Despite having served in city government for 20 years, including eight years as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections. Cleaver went on to defeat former [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration official [[Jamie Metzl]] in the Democratic primary by a margin of 60-40 percent. In the general election, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Jeanne Patterson made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as the second-most Democratic district in Missouri (behind the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]-based [[Missouri's 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District]]). The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949. By comparison, McCarthy won 65 percent of the vote in 2002.\n\n===2008 Democratic Presidential Primary Election===\nDuring the course of the contentious 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, Cleaver endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=2953 Missouri Rep.
