On the Appropriations Committee, Congressman Carter introduced an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to provide $12 million in funding to the section 287(g) of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA) which allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to delegate enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement allowing them to investigate, detain and arrest criminal aliens. However, this amendment was defeated in committee.\n\nAlso, when Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House of Representatives recessed in August 2008 for five weeks, Congressman Carter was one of many Republicans who stayed in Washington.  This was part of a GOP protest, in which they claimed that Congress should not have recessed for five weeks without addressing the energy crisis many Americans were facing. The [[Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that as of 2008 among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Carter had the second-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog \u2013 Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances' |date=August 8, 2008 |url=http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/ |publisher=Sunlight Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812021937/http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/ |archivedate=August 12, 2008 |df= }} Retrieved on Aug. 8, 2008</ref>\n\n===111th Congress===\nOn June 12, 2009, Carter signed on as a co-sponsor of [[H.R. 1503]], the bill introduced as a reaction to [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1503|date=|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01503:@@@P|publisher=The Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 2009, Carter called the 111th Congress a \"house of hypocrisy\" after the House of Representatives voted to rebuke [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] for his outburst, but would not go after New York Representative and House Ways and Means Chair [[Charlie Rangel]], who has been the subject of numerous ethical problems involving taxes and property.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speaking of apologies: Hypocrisy clouds Democrats\u2019 demand for \"You lie\" apology|date=|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/lawmaker-news/58767-speaking-of-apologies-hypocrisy-clouds-democrats-demand-for-you-lie-apology-rep-john-carter|publisher=The Hill}}</ref> Carter is also a proponent of the \"Rangel Rule,\" where [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] penalties and interest would be eliminated if one paid back taxes, similar to the treatment Rangel, [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]], and former [[South Dakota]] Senator (and one-time Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee) [[Tom Daschle]] received after their tax problems were made public.<ref>{{cite news|title=GOP Congressman Intros 'Rangel Rule,' Eliminating IRS Late Fees|date=January 28, 2009|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/28/gop-congressman-intros-rangel-rule-eliminating-irs-late-fees/|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}</ref>\n\nCarter introduced a \"Privileged Resolution\" that would have forced the resignation of Rangel from his position as [[House Ways and Means Committee]] Chair after he declined to resign voluntarily <ref>{{cite web|title=New Rangel Financial Violations Demand Removal from Ways and Means Chairmanship\n|date=|url=http://carter.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=40&parentid=6&sectiontree=6,40&itemid=1038|publisher=John Carter's House Page}}</ref> citing the inaction of the House Democratic Caucus and the ongoing investigations as reasons.

Though Carter listed the sale of the assets, he did not list the actual amount of capital gains, on which he did pay taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carter Refiling Disclosure Forms to List Exxon Profits|date=|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_45/news/39780-1.html}}</ref>\n\nOn November 16, 2009, Carter introduced legislation to give combatant casualty status to the victims of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], similar to those who were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carter's Resolution for Fort Hood Victims|date=|url=http://carter.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=40&sectiontree=6,40&itemid=1081}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2010, after Charlie Rangel was found to have broken House rules, Carter again demanded that Rangel step down. Rangel later stepped down, avoiding a third attempt at a privileged resolution to remove Rangel.\n\n==Political campaigns==\nCarter retired from the bench in 2001 in order to run for Congress in the newly created 31st District. After finishing second in the primary, he defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff \u2014 which was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Republican district. He has been consistently reelected without facing serious opposition.\n\nCarter originally represented a district that stretched from the suburbs of Austin to the fringes of the Houston suburbs, and also included [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], home of [[Texas A&M University]]. After the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], however, Carter now represents a district stretching from the fringes of the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Metroplex]] through more rural portions of Central Texas.  Redistricting after the 2010 census made the 31st more compact, and it now comprises [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]] and [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]].  The 31st District now includes [[Fort Hood]], home of the U.S. Army's [[3d Cavalry Regiment]] and the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]].\n\nIn the general election held on November 8, 2016, Carter won his eighth term in Congress.
