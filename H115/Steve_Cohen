For example, Cohen's support for a hate-crimes bill drew particularly strong opposition from most of the city's black ministers because it included a sexual orientation provision.  Cohen contends that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for the bill, and Harold Ford, Jr. had voted for it in the previous Congress.  Still, many of the city's black ministers tried to rally behind a consensus black candidate to challenge Cohen in the Democratic primary.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14810455 In Memphis, Debate Over a White Representative].

Cohen stated on his website,\n\n<blockquote>I believe the President should be impeached and removed from office. Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said 'there were very fine people on both sides.' There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Le Miere|first1=Jason|title=Trump impeachment process begins as Democrat states the president \"failed test of moral leadership\"|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-impeachment-process-charlottesville-president-651925|website=Newsweek|accessdate=19 August 2017|language=en|date=17 August 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Russian meddling====\nIn July 2018, Cohen stated that [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] amounted to \"an act of war\", which the U.S. needed to counter with \"cyber attacks against the [[Kremlin]]\". Speaking to Hill.TV's [[Buck Sexton]] and [[Krystal Ball]], he argued that Russia \"invaded our country\" by attacking free elections, and thus should be \"crippled\" by a retributory cyber attack.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manchester |first1=Julia |title=Dem calls Russia meddling 'act of war,' urges cyber attack on Moscow banks TWEET SHARE MORE |url=http://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/397366-dem-rep-no-question-that-russia-hacking-effort-is-act-of-war |website=The Hill |accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\nCohen has been interviewed on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and is a frequent guest on [[MSNBC]]'s [[Up with Chris Hayes]] and [[Current TV]]'s ''[[The Young Turks]]''.

In July 2013, CNN facilitated a DNA test with Cohen, Brink, and the man who raised her, John Brink. The test revealed that John Brink was in fact the father of Victoria.
