He then attended the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland-College Park]], earning a degree in political science and certification to be a [[paralegal]].

As a result, no serious candidates filed for office and Clay Jr. won the Democratic primary\u2014the real contest in this heavily Democratic district\u2014with 60 percent of the vote, and breezed to election in November. He has been reelected six times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 70 percent of the vote.\n\nFor his first six terms, Clay Jr. represented the northern two-thirds of St. Louis, while the southern third was located in [[Missouri's 3rd congressional district|the 3rd district]], represented by fellow Democrat [[Russ Carnahan]].  However, Missouri lost a congressional district as a result of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].

He is also a member of the [[House Financial Services Committee]]. Ordinarily, House Democrats who serve on the Financial Services Committee would have to give up their other committee assignments.  However, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] and House Financial Services Committee Chair [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]] granted him a waiver allowing him to remain on the Oversight Committee.\n\nClay made headlines in early 2007 when, as a member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] (co-founded by his father), he objected to the possible inclusion of [[U.S. Representative]] [[Steve Cohen]] of [[Tennessee]], a [[White (U.S. Census)|Caucasian]] who represents the majority-[[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]] district in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and had made a campaign promise to attempt to become the first white member of the CBC.

He's white and the Caucus is black. It's time to move on. We have racial policies to pursue and we are pursuing them, as Mr. Cohen has learned. It's an unwritten rule. It's understood.\" In response to the decision, Cohen stated, \"It's their caucus and they do things their way. You don't force your way in.\"<ref name=\"politico\"/> Clay issued an official statement from his office in reply to Cohen's complaint: \"Quite simply, Rep. Cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept \u2014 there has been an unofficial Congressional White Caucus for over 200 years, and now it's our turn to say who can join 'the club.' He does not, and cannot, meet the membership criteria, unless he can change his skin color.

They reported that in the 2006 election cycle, Michelle Clay's law office, Clay and Associates, received $51,800 in consulting fees from her brother's campaign funds, along with an additional $9,963 for reimbursements. In the 2004 election cycle, Michelle Clay's firm received $52,514 for consulting, and in 2002 Michelle Clay herself was paid $32,000 for campaign management and legal fees.

The painting in question shows police officers apprehending suspects, and the police are depicted as pigs. The painting is displayed near the police security checkpoint. Rep [[Duncan D. Hunter]] took down the painting only to have Clay re-hang it. Several Republicans, including [[Doug Lamborn]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and [[Brian Babin]] took down the painting, only to have Clay re-hang it each time.
