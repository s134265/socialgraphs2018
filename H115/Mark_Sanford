Had this veto stood, the state government would have shut down on July 1. He explained his veto as being the only way to get the cuts he desired, and that using the line item veto would have been inadequate as well as impossible. However, in a special session the following day, both houses dismissed Sanford's call for reform by overriding his veto\u2013effectively restoring their original budget.<ref>{{Cite news|title=South Carolina Showdown Is Set Up by a Budget Veto|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E0DD1031F936A25755C0A9609C8B63|date=June 15, 2006|accessdate=June 24, 2009|first=Brenda|last=Goodman|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nSanford professed to be a firm supporter of limited government. Later in his tenure, he embarked on a plan to reform methods of funding the state's public education system, including measures such as [[school vouchers]]\u2013 aimed at introducing more competition into the school system as a means of fostering improvement. The plan, known as \"Put Parents In Charge\", proposed to provide around $2,500 per child to parents who chose to withdraw their children from the state's public school system and instead send them to independent schools. Sanford framed this plan as a necessary market-based reform.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn 2003, Sanford sought to reform the state's public college system. Sanford has criticized these schools as focusing too much on separately creating research institutions and not on educating the young adults of South Carolina. Sanford also suggested that they combine some programs as a means of curbing tuition increases. The schools did not respond positively to this suggestion, however, causing Sanford to remark that \"if any institution ultimately feels uncomfortable with our push toward coordination, they can exit the system and go private.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Sanford urges privatization|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2003/12/06/met_388896.shtml|work=The Augusta Chronicle|accessdate=May 8, 2013|date=December 6, 2003}}</ref>\n\nSanford also indicated a desire to increase the powers of the executive branch.
