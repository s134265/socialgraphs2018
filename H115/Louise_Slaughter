She was involved in a local environmental group, the Perinton Greenlands Association, which promoted recycling and opposed development of [[Hart's Woods]].  Slaughter decided to run for the Monroe County Legislature, winning on her third try. In 1975, while in the county legislature, she accepted an offer from then-[[New York Secretary of State]] [[Mario Cuomo]] to serve as his regional coordinator in the Rochester area.

Moderate Republican [[Barber Conable]] had represented the district for 20 years before giving way in 1985 to a considerably more conservative Republican, [[Fred J. Eckert]]. Slaughter defeated Eckert by one point in the 1986 midterm election.<ref name=\"WaPoObit\" />\n\nRedistricting after the 1990 census renumbered Slaughter's district as the 28th District and turned it into a much more compact district comprising a narrow ribbon in Monroe County. In the process, she picked up the remainder of Rochester. At the same time, the neighboring 29th District of 30-year incumbent Republican [[Frank Horton (New York politician)|Frank Horton]], a close friend of Slaughter's, was dismantled, and his home was drawn into the new 28th.  The district had already been moving away from its moderate Republican roots, but the new territory made the district solidly Democratic.
