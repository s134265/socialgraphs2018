He has said he supports the so-called budget repair bill because it is fiscally responsible. In a recent press interview, he said that he did not \"find it impressive\" that over 70,000 protesters marched on the capitol.<ref name=\"protests not\"/>\n\nDuring the protests, Grothman was cornered by almost 200 pro-union protesters yelling \"Shame! Shame!\" outside the state capitol building. Grothman said he was not concerned about violence at the time, adding that, \"They're loud, they'll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they're just mostly college kids having fun, just like they're having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That's the guts of that crowd.\" He also described the protesters as \"a different breed of person\" and \"a bunch of slobs taking up the building.\"<ref name=\"lawmaker chased\"/><ref name=\"slobs\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Grothman also advocated the hiring of more business-friendly individuals to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  In doing so, he went out of his way to single out one of the University of Wisconsin campuses as a target: \"Maybe you (should) look to hire those people who know what the real world is like, rather than a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point who doesn't know what the real world is like.\"  This was only days before appearing at UW\u2013Stevens Point with the Joint Finance Committee for a day of hearings on Scott Walker's budget bill.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/119195389.html \"Grothman urges DNR to hire older workers\"] JSOnline \u2013 All Politics Blog, April 4, 2011; retrieved April 11, 2011.</ref>\n\nGrothman was subject to a recall effort in the spring of 2011, but the effort failed, collecting only 75% of the required signatures.<ref>Bill Schanen IV, [http://www.ozaukeepress.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1793:aggressive-effort-to-recall-grothman-falls-short&catid=49:feature-1 \"Aggressive effort to recall Grothman falls short\"], Ozaukee Press, May 4, 2011.</ref> During the recall, Grothman supporters gathered hundreds of signatures for a giant \"Thank You\" card for Grothman.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n===2014 election===\n{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Wisconsin, 2014#District 6}}\nOn April 3, 2014, Grothman announced he would run in that year's Republican primary for {{ushr|WI|6}} against 17-term incumbent [[Tom Petri]].

However, his state senate district included much of the southeastern portion of the congressional district. In the summer of 2014, Grothman moved to [[Campbellsport, Wisconsin|Campellsport]], a suburb of [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], which is located in the 6th District.<ref>[http://gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/page/nomination_paper_tracking_08_12_2014_partisan_prim_14421.PDF Nomination Paper Tracking Report] for 2014 election from [[Wisconsin Government Accountability Board]]</ref>\n\nIn the general election, Grothman defeated the Democratic nominee, [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnebago County]] Executive Mark Harris, with 57 percent of the vote.\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on the Budget|Committee on the Budget]]'''\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]]'''\n**[[United States House Education Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education|Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education]]\n**[[United States House Education Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions|Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]'''\n**[[United States House Oversight Subcommittee on Government Operations|Subcommittee on Government Operations]]\n**[[United States House Oversight Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Assets|Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Assets]]\n*'''[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]]'''\n*'''[[Republican Study Committee]]'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Member List|author=|url=https://rsc-walker.house.gov/|format=|publisher=Republican Study Committee|date=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Political positions==\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' has described Grothman as \"a shambling, strident conservative with a Trumpian tell-it-like-it-is streak who typically votes with the House GOP leadership\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/forget-senate-negotiators-house-conservatives-feel-no-pressure-to-deal-on-immigration/2018/01/26/1962bbbe-0255-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html|title=Forget Senate negotiators \u2014 House conservatives could have the last word on immigration|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|date=2018-01-26|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\n===4-year-old kindergarten===\nGrothman believes the kindergarten program for 4-year-olds should be defunded by Governor Scott Walker, making a false claim that any academic benefits disappear by the fourth grade.
