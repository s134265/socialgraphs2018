He served as Chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus when the Democrats had control of the House, and currently serves as the Vice Chair.  He is also a former Chair of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee and the current Ranking Member.  Congressman Visclosky also opposed actions that would have certain components of advanced U.S. Military weapons and hardware made in foreign countries, most notably in China, which caused the closing of U.S.-based manufacturing centers, such as \"Magnequench\" in Valparaiso, Indiana, which was covered heavily in the media, most notably in printed media from his district, namely \"The Times\" <ref>[http://www.nwitimes.com/] \"[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]]\"</ref> and \"The Post Tribune\",<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/] \"[[The Post-Tribune]]\"</ref> both servicing Northwest Indiana.  In this particular case, the component was a sophisticated, high-tech magnet, made of rare earth metals, that is an integral part of U.S. smart-bombs and guided missile systems, including the \"Joint Direct Attack Munition\" or \"JDAM\".<ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/04/07/the-saga-of-magnequench/ The Saga of Magnequench] ''[[CounterPunch]]''</ref> The information involving these incidents can still be found by searching the archives and articles on the referenced websites of the previously named media outlets.\n\nVisclosky is one of the 126 Democrats who voted against the [[Iraq War Resolution]].

In 2007 and 2008, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]], of which Visclosky is a member, directed $137 million in government purchasing to PMA's clients.
