During the bitter primary campaign, Schweikert was widely criticised for a mailer that accused Quayle of \"going both ways\", suggesting that he was [[bisexual]]. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator [[Jon Kyl]] said that \"such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office\" and Senator [[John McCain]] said the mailer was one of the \"worst that I have seen\" and that it \"crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse.\" Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer \"utterly false\" and \"a sleazy smear tactic.\" Schweikert's spokesman responded that people \"should get their minds out of the gutter\" because the mailer was \"obviously\" referring to \"'both ways'\u2014as in liberal and conservative.\" ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' asked two political scientists to review the mailer, who both said that they had \"never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way\" and said that it was \"difficult to believe\" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2012/08/06/kyl-faults-schweikert-after-mailer.html |title=Kyl faults Schweikert after mailer says Quayle 'goes both ways' \u2013 Phoenix Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nowicki |first=Dan |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/08/03/20120803district-6-schweikert-like-fight-in-dc.html |title=District 6 race: David Schweikert says 'I like the fight' in D.C |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/members/Blog/azdc/169420 |title=azcentral.com staff blogs \u2013 AZ/DC Blog \u2013 azdc \u2013 McCain endorses Quayle, scolds Schweikert for mailer |publisher=Archive.azcentral.com |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/243973-mccain-blasts-arizona-republican-who-accused-quayle-of-going-both-ways |title=McCain blasts Arizona Republican who accused Quayle of \u2018going both ways\u2019 |publisher=TheHill.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the 6th contained almost two-thirds of Quayle's constituents, Schweikert defeated Quayle in the Republican primary\u2014the real contest in this heavily Republican district\u2014by 53 percent to Quayle's 47 percent.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news |last=Zapler |first=Mike|last2=Isenstadt|first2=Alex|title=Arizona House primary results: Ben Quayle booted from Congress|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80331.html |newspaper=Politico.com|accessdate=2015-04-01 |date=August 29, 2012}}</ref> He won re-election to a second term with 62% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/AZ |title=2014 Election Results Senate: Map by State, Live Midterm Voting Updates |publisher=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\n[[File:David Schweikert by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Congressman Schweikert speaking at a rally in August 2014.]]\n;Abortion\nSchweikert is [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]].<ref name=\"Skotzko\">Stacey Skotzko, [https://schweikert.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/cq-member-profiles-112th-congress CQ Member Politics: 112th Congress:  In The News], ''CQ'' (August 11, 2011).</ref> He has attributed his opposition to abortion to his own adoption.<ref name=DailyCaller>{{cite news|last=Schweikert|first=David|title=Why I am pro-life|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/01/21/why-i-am-pro-life/|work=Daily Caller|date=January 21, 2012}}</ref> For 2015\u20132016, the abortion-rights group [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] gave Schweikert a 0% rating,<ref>[http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2016-congressional-record-on.pdf 2016 Congressional Record on Choice], [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], pp. 16\u201317.</ref> while the anti-abortion [[National Right to Life]] gave Schweikert a 100% rating.<ref>[https://www.capwiz.com/nrlc/scorecard.xc?chamber=H&state=US&session=114&x=11&y=18 Federal NRLC Scorecard -
