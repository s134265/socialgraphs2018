Rush is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|IL|1}}, serving in Congress for more than two decades; he was first elected in 1992 and took office in 1993. He has since won consecutive re-election. The district was located principally on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], with a population from 2003 to early 2013 that was 65% [[African-American]], a higher proportion than any other [[congressional district]] in the nation. In 2011 the [[Illinois General Assembly]] redistricted this area following the 2010 census. While still [[minority-majority]], since early 2013 it is 51.3% African American, 9.8% Latino and 2% Asian. It re-elected Rush in 2016. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Rush is the only politician to have defeated [[Barack Obama]] in an election, which he did in the [[Illinois's 1st congressional district election, 2000|2000 Democratic primary for Illinois' 1st congressional district]]. A civil rights activist during the 1960s, Rush became radicalized for a period and founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]].\n\n==Early life, education, and activism==\nRush was born on November 23, 1946 in [[Albany, Georgia]]. After his parents separated when Rush was 7 years old, his mother took him and his siblings to [[Chicago, Illinois]], joining the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans out of the South in the first part of the 20th century. In 1963 Rush dropped out of high school before graduating; he joined the [[U.S. Army]]. While stationed in Chicago in 1966, he joined the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], which had helped obtain national civil rights legislation passed in 1964 and 1965. In 1968, he went [[AWOL]] from the Army and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]]. He later finished his service, receiving an honorable discharge from the Army.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Rush was involved in the [[civil rights movement]] and worked in civil disobedience campaigns in the [[southern United States]].
