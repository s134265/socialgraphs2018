Until one young man assaulted me in a crude and insulting way and I ran, alone, into the cold, dark night.\u201d In an interview given the next day, she said the assault was part of \u201ca prank\u201d intended to humiliate her. She also said that when she was 23 and working as an aide on Capitol Hill, her boss took her to dinner with a \u201cdistinguished guest of the United States Congress,\u201d who, under the table, put his hand under her skirt. Not long after, she was assaulted and mugged on a Washington street. Until these revelations, she had not told anybody about these incidents. She said she had been motivated to come forward by a sexual assault case at [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nilsen |first1=Ella |title=U.S. Rep.

Sexual assault is a notoriously underreported crime. At Dartmouth, we want to see the number of reported incidents go up and the prevalence of incidents go down. Although the growing climate of reporting is encouraging, even one sexual assault is too many. It is revelations like Representative Kuster's that demonstrate why we must continue to expand our efforts in prevention, response, and accountability.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Dartmouth Statement on Rep.
