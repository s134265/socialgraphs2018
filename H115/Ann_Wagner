The district, based in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], is heavily suburban and the wealthiest district in the state. It includes most of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]'s southern and western suburbs as well as some of the northern exurbs in [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]] and the northern portion of [[Jefferson County, Missouri|Jefferson County]].\n\nWagner is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Previously, she served as the [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States Ambassador]] to [[Luxembourg]] from 2005 to 2009. Prior to her diplomatic post, Wagner was Chair of the [[Missouri Republican Party]] for six years, from 1999 until 2005, and Co-chair of the [[Republican National Committee]] for four years.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWagner was born and raised in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. She attended [[Cor Jesu Academy]], a private Catholic all-girls school in South County, and graduated from the [[University of Missouri]] in 1984 with a [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration|BSBA]] from the business school with an emphasis in [[logistics]]. After college, she went to work in the private sector and held management positions at [[Hallmark Cards]] in [[Kansas City]] and [[Ralston Purina]] in [[St. Louis]].<ref name=\"annwagner.com\">{{cite web|url=http://annwagner.com/meet-ann/ |accessdate=October 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215542/http://annwagner.com/meet-ann/ |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Pre-congressional political career ==\n\n===1990s===\nWagner entered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics in 1990, heading the GOP's efforts during the [[decennial]] redistricting of Missouri. In 1992, she was state director of the unsuccessful campaign for the reelection of President [[George H.W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dan Quayle]].\n\n===2000s===\n\n====Chairwoman of Missouri GOP====\nShe was elected to her first term of office as chair of the Missouri Republican Party in 1999, becoming the first woman to occupy the position. Her most notable achievement in that role came during her second two-year term when she oversaw the party's taking of majority control of both chambers of the [[Missouri General Assembly]], winning the [[Missouri State Senate|Senate]] in a 2001 [[special election]] and the [[Missouri House of Representatives|House]] in the 2002 [[general election]], the first time this had been seen for over 40 years. During her third term, the party held its majorities in both chambers and also took the Governor's seat for the first time in 12 years with the election of [[Matt Blunt]] in 2004, giving the GOP complete control of state government for the first time since 1921. Her six years as chairperson witnessed [[George W. Bush]] carry Missouri in both of his presidential bids and also saw the Republican Party win a majority of the state's congressional delegation.\n\n====National campaigning====\nIn 2001, she took office as a co-chair of the [[Republican National Committee]] and helped preside over the [[2004 Republican National Convention]]. In this position, she took a strong role in directing the development of the Winning Women initiative, whose aim was to improve the image of the GOP towards women and demonstrate the relevance of its platform to them. Her work with the committee took her to 48 states. In January 2005, she left her role as co-chair after one term.\n\nIn 2004, Wagner was a fundraising \"[[Bush Pioneer|ranger]]\" for President George W. Bush.\n\n====U.S. Ambassadorship====\nOn February 20, 2005, Wagner was elected to a fourth term as Chair of the Missouri Republican Party. On May 16, she was nominated by President Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to Luxembourg]]. On July 16, 2005, she was confirmed in the post by a voice vote in the [[United States Senate]], after which [[U.S. Senator]] [[Jim Talent]] (R-Mo.) said that she was, \"A considerate woman, whose character and abilities uniquely qualify her to represent our nation.\"\n\nOn August 1, she was sworn in as Ambassador by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] in the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Room of the [[Harry S.
