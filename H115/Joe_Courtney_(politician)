He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n==Early life and education ==\n\nCourtney grew up in suburban Hartford. In 1975 he graduated from [[Tufts University]]. He earned a law degree from the [[University of Connecticut School of Law]] in 1978.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Prior to Congress ===\nAfter graduating from law school, Courtney worked as a public defender for three years. He became a partner in the law firm Courtney, Boyan & Foran, and also served as Town Attorney in [[Vernon, Connecticut]], where he lives.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1994, Courtney served in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]], representing Connecticut's 56th district. He was chairman of the Public Health and Human Service Committee and oversaw the Blue Ribbon Commission on Universal Health Insurance. In 1994, he was honored by [[Connecticut Magazine]] for his bipartisan efforts in the state house.\n\nIn 1998, after four years out of office, Courtney made an unsuccessful bid for [[Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]]. In 2002, he ran for Congress against incumbent Republican [[Rob Simmons]]. Courtney did not announce his candidacy or raise money until September 2001; by that time, Simmons had more than $500,000 in campaign funding. Simmons defeated Courtney in the November election, 54% to 46%.<ref>{{cite news |title=House Rules|newspaper=Washington Post |author= Michael Leahy |date=June 10, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/05/AR2007060501702_pf.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Election to Congress ===\n;2006\n[[File:Joe Courtney, official 110th Congress photo portrait.jpg|thumb|Courtney's first official Congress photograph]]\nCourtney [[United States House of Representatives elections in Connecticut, 2006#District 2|challenged Simmons again in 2006]], in a race that political strategists projected would be very close.
