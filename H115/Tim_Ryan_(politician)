As the result of [[redistricting]] following the 2000 [[census]], the 17th, which had long been based in Youngstown, had been pushed to the west and now included much of [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage County]] and part of Akron. Before the redistricting, all of Akron had been part of the 14th District, represented by eight-term Democrat [[Thomas C. Sawyer|Tom Sawyer]]. The 14th had been eliminated in the year 2000 redistricting; most of it was drawn into the 13th District of fellow Democrat [[Sherrod Brown]], but Sawyer's home was drawn into the 17th.

He won with 51 percent of the vote, besting Benjamin by a solid 14-point margin. When he took office in January 2003, he was the youngest Democrat in the House, at 29 years of age.
