He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district extends from the [[Rio Grande]] to the [[suburb]]s of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].\n\nOutside politics he has served as a professor at the [[Texas A&M International University]] in his native [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]. The son of [[migrant worker]]s who never made it past the fifth grade, Cuellar has positioned himself as a strong advocate for education and has often described himself as \"the most degreed member of Congress,\" having earned an [[associates degree]], a [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] in Foreign Service, a [[master's degree]] in International Trade, a law degree, and a [[Ph.D.]] in Government. Two schools in Laredo are named in his honor.\n\n==Background==\nCuellar was born in Laredo, the [[county seat]] of [[Webb County, Texas|Webb County]] in [[South Texas]], where he has resided most of his life. Cuellar's parents, Martin S., Sr., and Odilia Cuellar, who are Mexican-Americans, traveled as far north as [[Idaho]] each year performing migrant labor but decided to remain in Laredo when Martin found work as a gardener and ranch manager. With eight children, the family lived on Reynolds Street in the Las Lomas neighborhood of \"The Heights\" part of Laredo. None of the streets there were then paved. The parents knew no [[English language|English]] but instilled the [[work ethic]] in their children.<ref name=cuellarhomeinterview>David McCumber of [[Hearst Newspapers]], \"From the House on the Hill: Congressman looks back at his life\", ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', September 29, 2014, pp. 1, 7A</ref>\n\nHenry is the oldest of the Cuellars' children. His brother, Martin, Jr., is the [[sheriff]] of Webb County, having been first elected in 2008 over the incumbent fellow Democrat Rick Flores. A sister, Rosie Cuellar-Castillo, is the Laredo municipal judge, having  won a [[nonpartisan]] [[runoff election]] held for that position on December 11, 2010.<ref>Nick Georgiou, \"Judge vote is closest: Cuellar-Castillo wins by 9.4 points,\" ''Laredo Morning Times'', December 12, 2010, p. 1</ref>\n\nCuellar attended Buenos Aires Elementary School, where he became an avid reader, and graduated in 1973 from [[J. W. Nixon High School]], a classmate of future Webb County District Attorney [[Joe Rubio, Jr.]] He received an associate degree from [[Laredo Community College]] (then known as Laredo Junior College), where he would later teach courses in government on a part-time basis. He then attended the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' with a bachelor's degree in foreign service. He also holds a master's degree in International Trade from Texas A&M International University in Laredo and a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], both in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].\n\nCuellar opened his own law firm in Laredo in 1981 and became a licensed customs broker in 1983. He worked at his ''[[alma mater]]'', TAMIU, as an [[adjunct professor]] for International Commercial Law from 1984 to 1986.\n\n==Early political career==\n\n===Texas House of Representatives===\nPrior to being elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], Cuellar was a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from 1987 to 2001, having represented the major portion of Laredo. During his fourteen years as Laredo's state representative, he served in leadership positions in the House Appropriations, Higher Education, and Calendar committees. His most notable accomplishments in the Texas State Legislature included coauthoring the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which ensured health-care for thousands of previously uninsured children, and cosponsoring the largest tax cut in Texas history, which included a three-day tax holiday for consumers and small businesses. He also served on several national legislative committees dealing with state budgets, the U.S./Mexico border, and international trade.\n\n===Texas Secretary of State===\nIn 2001, Cuellar was appointed as [[Secretary of State of Texas]] by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]]. Though in office for only eight months, he worked to expand initiatives to register and educate voters and to protect voters' rights. He expanded the Border/Mexico Affairs office. As of 2018, Cuellar is the last Democrat to hold the position.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n\n;2002\nIn the 2002 election, Cuellar was the Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives in [[Texas's 23rd congressional district]]. He lost to five-term incumbent Republican [[Henry Bonilla]] by 52\u201347 in the closest race Bonilla had faced up to that date. Bonilla was unseated in 2006 in the revised 23rd District by the [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]] Democrat [[Ciro Rodriguez]].\n\n;2004\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2004|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2006#District 28|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2008#District 28|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2010#District 28}}\nCuellar spent much of the early part of 2003 preparing for a rematch against Bonilla. The [[2003 Texas redistricting]], however, shifted most of Laredo, which had been the heart of the 23rd since its creation in 1966, into the [[Texas's 28th congressional district|28th district]], represented by Ciro Rodriguez. Cuellar challenged Rodriguez, a former friend, for the nomination and won it by fifty-eight votes.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://asp.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/CandidateProfile.aspx?ci=327&oi=H |work=USA Today |date=April 16, 2004 |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |title=Henry Roberto Cuellar (D) <img src=\"http://images.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/_common/images/D_medium.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"22\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"><br />Challenger |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050915022643/http://asp.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/CandidateProfile.aspx?ci=327&oi=H |archivedate=September 15, 2005}}</ref> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' described the campaign as \"nasty ... with Cuellar claiming Rodriguez was an AWOL congressman, while Rodriguez called Cuellar a political opportunist.\"  The initial count gave Rodriguez a 145-vote lead, but after a recount Cuellar led by 58 votes. \"Rodriguez filed a lawsuit questioning the eligibility of hundreds of votes.

In November, he defeated Republican Jim Hopson of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]] by a 20-point margin, becoming the first Laredoan in over 20 years elected to represent the 28th District of Texas. Cuellar's election to the House in 2004 was a standout for Democrats in a year in which Republicans otherwise gained seats in Texas' delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n;2006\n\nOn March 7, 2006, Cuellar again defeated Rodriguez in the Democratic primary with 52 percent of the vote in a three-way race. No Republican even attempted to file, ostensibly assuring him of reelection in November.\n\nOn June 29, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that the [[Texas Legislature]] had violated the rights of Latino voters when it shifted most of Laredo out of the 23rd and replaced it with several heavily Republican [[San Antonio]] suburbs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/29/ap/politics/mainD8IHPP180.shtml |title=Redistrict Ruling May Affect Nov Election, Ruling That Congressional District in Texas Is Unconstitutional May Effect Nov Election \u2013 CBS News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005151900/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/29/ap/politics/mainD8IHPP180.shtml |archivedate=October 5, 2008 }}</ref> As a result, nearly every congressional district from [[El Paso]] to San Antonio had to be redrawn, and the primary results for these districts were invalidated. A court drew a new map in which all of Laredo was moved into the 28th district while the south San Antonio area was moved to the 23rd. An election open to all candidates with a [[two-round system|runoff]] if no candidate won 50% was scheduled for the date of the general election, November 7, 2006.\n\nIn the general election on November 7, 2006, Cuellar had no Republican opposition but handily defeated Ron Avery of [[McQueeney, Texas|McQueeney]], the chairman of the conservative [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] in [[Guadalupe County, Texas|Guadalupe County]] and trial attorney and Democrat Frank Enriquez of McAllen by taking nearly 68 percent of the more than 77,000 votes cast in the House race.\n\nCuellar's two main political rivals, Bonilla and Rodriguez, ran against each other in the 23rd, and Rodriguez won the election in the runoff. The Republican Bonilla was hence out of Congress for the first time since his upset election in 1992.\n\n;2008\n\nCuellar was unopposed in the March 4, 2008 Democratic primary.\n\nIn the November 4 [[general election]], Cuellar easily defeated Republican James Taylor Fish.<ref>Julian Aguilar, \"DA, sheriff tilts evoke lively campaign brawls\", ''Laredo Morning Times'', January 4, 2008, pp. 1, 11A; http://preview.ussearch.com/preview/newsearch;jsessionid=618096F8C7F060B6E662B8F7B2BCCEF9?searchFName=james&searchMName=&searchLName=fish&searchCity=cibolo&searchState=TX&searchApproxAge=45&adID=10002101&searchtab=people&x=40&y=15 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105051712/http://preview.ussearch.com/preview/newsearch |date=2008-01-05 }}</ref> Jim Fish, as he is known, was a health-care administrator for seventeen years while he served in the [[United States Air Force]].

Underwood had also refused on one occasion to present his identification to a law enforcement officer.\n\nCuellar prevailed, as expected, with 62,055 votes (56 percent) to Underwood's 46,417 (42 percent). The remaining 1,880 votes (2 percent) were cast for Libertarian Party candidate Stephen Kaat.

Bush]] and has made bipartisanship a watchword of his political career. In the 2006 primary, he gained the endorsement of the [[Club for Growth]], a conservative group that usually endorses Republicans. His endorsement of Bush for President in 2000 heightened concerns for a time that he might defect to the GOP, but he supported [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]] in 2004. At the joint session of Congress at which Bush delivered his 2006 [[State of the Union]] address, a ''Washington Post'' photographer snapped a photo of Cuellar standing on the Republican side of the aisle, beaming as President Bush affectionately grabbed his face. Soon after the release of this photo, campaign contributions for his Democratic primary opponent, Ciro Rodriguez, saw an immediate and considerable increase. Cuellar defeated Rodriguez in the primary election and since then has played a more significant role in the Democratic House Caucus.\n\nOn February 10, 2010, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' ran an article headlined \"Long shunned, Cuellar now embraced by House Dems\" by Molly K. Hooper.  It began: \"Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) is finally a member of the club. Shunned by Democratic colleagues years ago, Cuellar has worked to build relationships in the House and is no longer considered an outsider in his own caucus.\"  Hooper noted that while House Democrats had been irked by Cuellar's 2004 primary challenge to Rodriguez and his 2000 endorsement of Bush, \"Times have changed. Cuellar ... has been a team player at crucial times this Congress. Days before the House climate change vote, Cuellar was telling a colleague he was going to vote no when Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tapped him on the shoulder. 'Henry,' Pelosi said, 'can I talk to you about your vote?' President Barack Obama also lobbied Cuellar, who subsequently voted for the bill. Under pressure from the White House, the 54-year-old lawmaker also backed the healthcare bill after securing provisions on medical malpractice.\"\n\nNonetheless, noted Hooper, \"Cuellar...still votes against his party. He rejected the first House bailout bill, which was voted down, but backed the final version that passed in the fall of 2008. Cuellar was also one of 27 Democrats who opposed the House financial regulatory reform bill, a top priority for Obama.

Michael McCaul (Texas).\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Hooper|first=Molly|title=Long shunned, Dems embrace Cuellar|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/80461-long-shunned-cuellar-now-embraced-by-house-dems|newspaper=The Hill|date=10 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nCuellar has sometimes been criticized by fellow Democrats for being too close to Republicans.{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  It has occasionally been suggested during his career that he would switch to the Republican Party.{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  In an interview in September 2014, Cuellar said: \"I'm a Democrat, and I will die as a Democrat ... if a person, an elected official, puts party before their country or their state, it's wrong. We're certainly seeing that in Washington, where party comes first, and if you're not loyal to the party, there's something wrong with you. The easy for thing for me is to always go along with the Democratic Party, but that would not serve my state and that would not serve the district itself... I'm the first Democrat that pays my dues [to the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|DCCC]]]... I pay more than anybody, any other Democrat, congressional member, in the state of Texas. I've done that for the last couple of years. I don't go around and say, 'I give more money than anybody,' but I support my party. If you are going to have a litmus test \u2014 out of 100 votes, you support your party and that makes you a good member of Congress? I think that's the wrong litmus test. What's good for America and what's good for Texas, that should be the litmus test.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/rep-henry-cuellar-i-will-die-as-a-democrat |title=Rep.

As a [[pro-life]] Democrat, Cuellar expressed concerns that the Senate health care bill allowed federal funding for abortion. Cuellar voted on March 21, 2010, for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which passed the chamber by a vote of 219\u2013212.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christina Bellantoni | date =March 20, 2010 |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/cuellar-to-vote-yes.php |title=Cuellar To Vote 'Yes' &#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>\n\nOn June 15, 2007, Cuellar announced that he was endorsing then [[U.S. Senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]] for President in 2008, saying that \"Senator Clinton is the only candidate with the experience and toughness to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House.\" In 2007, Cuellar held a fundraiser for Clinton in Laredo, which raised over $200,000 \u2013 aided by the presence of former President [[Bill Clinton]]. Laredo's Democratic [[Mayor]] [[Raul G. Salinas]] joined Cuellar in giving his early support to Hillary Clinton, who came to Laredo in October 2008 to endorse Cuellar's reelection to the U.S. House. On November 4, 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Webb County  with 71% of the vote to McCain's 28%.\n\nCongressman Cuellar is the author and one of two main co-sponsors of legislation seeking to honor slain ICE agent [[Jaime Zapata]]. Billed as a [http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/article/Border-security-bill-named-after-slain-ICE-agent-1042950.php border security bill], it would increase cooperation among state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies during investigations of human and drug smuggling from Mexico.\n\nOn July 24, 2013, Cuellar voted to continue funding NSA surveillance of U.S. citizens who are not suspected of committing any crime, in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights according to some views of the Bill of Rights.\n\nIn 2013, in a statement with House colleagues [[Beto O'Rourke]] of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Filemon Vela, Jr.|Filemon Vela]] of [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], Cuellar renewed his opposition to a border fence along the Rio Grande between the United States and Mexico. He denounced inclusion in the Senate immigration bill of an amendment sponsored by [[Bob Corker]] of [[Tennessee]] and [[John Hoeven]] of [[North Dakota]], which calls for seven hundred additional miles of border fencing. Cuellar called the fence an antiquated solution to a new-age problem. The fence, he said, ignores the economic ties between the two nations which reached $500 billion in 2012.<ref>JJ Velasquez, \"Immigration Reform: Cuellar sounds off on Senate bill\", ''Laredo Morning Times'', July 5, 2013, pp. 1, 9A</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Cuellar was the only House Democrat to vote for a House bill that would have made it easier to deport unaccompanied minors to [[Central America]]. He also released unauthorized photographs of unsanitary conditions in [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] [[Immigration detention|detention centers]]. Despite these actions, Cuellar said he is firmly in support of \"comprehensive immigration reform\".<ref name=cuellarhomeinterview/>\n\nIn May 2015, Cuellar called for 55 more federal judges to handle the overload of some 450,000 immigration cases. There are currently 260 such judges in 58 courts. Twenty-eight of the judges serve Texas; no immigration judge holds court in Laredo. Many of those awaiting hearings are held in detention centers or released on bond. In many cases those on bond never come to their scheduled hearings. Cuellar said South Texas and Laredo have particular need for the judges.<ref>Gabriela A.
