Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order.  This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] (R-IL) as a joke.

The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the [[oral health]] problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], make grants available to educate 12- to 17-year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to [[oral health]] and the provision of dental care.<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/id02_simpson/meth_mouth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504232512/http://www.house.gov/list/press/id02_simpson/meth_mouth.html |archivedate=2009-05-04 |df= }}</ref> As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] to the [[Subcommittee on Health]] where it has been debated, but never brought to a conclusion.
