The legislation could be re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]] for consideration. The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which, if untreated, could lead to [[Type 2 diabetes]] for both mother and child.\n\n===Global health===\nRep.

The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown [[biofuel]]s like [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], and [[biobutanol]].\n\nEngel has introduced into Congress, with Congressmen Kingston, [[Steve Israel]] (D-NY), and [[Bob Inglis]] (R-SC) the Open Fuel Standards Act.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr1476ih/pdf/BILLS-111hr1476ih.pdf|title=H.R. 1476 (111th Congress)|publisher=Government Printing Office}}</ref> This bill requires 50 percent of new cars sold in the [[United States]] by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s capable of running on any combination of [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[gasoline]].

The transfer fee, when used correctly, can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable. The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Engel introduced [[SNOPA]], the Social Network Online Protection Act.
