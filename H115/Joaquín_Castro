In 2002, Cornyn, the state's then one-term [[Attorney General of Texas|attorney general]], filed to succeed retiring Republican Senator [[Phil Gramm]], while two other Republican hopefuls, [[Henry Bonilla]] of [[Texas's 23rd congressional district]] and [[David Dewhurst]], the [[Texas General Land Office|land commissioner]] and later the [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|lieutenant governor]], vacillated and lost their chance to become a senator.
