This was a seriously contested race, receiving a deal of national coverage and significant support from the Republican Party. [[Newt Gingrich]] personally visited the district during the campaign. Aderholt won narrowly, 50%\u201348%, becoming only the second Republican to represent this district since Reconstruction. The first, [[James D. Martin|Jim Martin]], was swept into office in what was then the 7th District during the 1964 wave that delivered the state's electoral votes to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Aderholt has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected nine times. He even ran unopposed in 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2016.\n\nAderholt's increasing margins reflected the growing Republican trend in this part of Alabama. While Democrats still have a majority in voter registration, the district's Democrats are very conservative on social issues, even by Alabama standards. With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+30, it is the fifth-most Republican district in the nation and the third-most Republican district east of the Mississippi.\n\n===2010 campaign===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2010#District 4}}\n\n===2012 campaign===\n{{further|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2012#District 4}}\nAderholt was reelected in the November election where he beat [[Alabama House of Representatives|State representative]] [[Daniel Boman]], the Democratic nominee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alabama Secretary of State |url=http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2012/primary/Primary_Results_Certified-Democratic-2012-03-22.pdf|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911125014/http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2012/primary/Primary_Results_Certified-Democratic-2012-03-22.pdf|archivedate=September 11, 2012}}</ref>\nIn 2012 Aderholt raised $1,207,484.98 for his campaign, but spent only $963,859.15.
