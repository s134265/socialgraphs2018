His home in Johnston County had been drawn into the district; it had previously been in the [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]].\n\nIn the Republican primary, Rouzer defeated both 2010 nominee [[Ilario Pantano]] and Randy Crow, but won just four of the district's twelve counties: Johnston (82%), Sampson (49%), Lenoir (43%), and Hoke (38%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/36596/80787/en/md.html?cid=201020007 |title=North Carolina State Board of Elections : State Wide Primary Election : 2012 |website=Results.enr.clarityelections.com |accessdate=2016-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=740235 |title=NC District 07- R Primary Race - May 08, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-03-04}}</ref>  However, his margin in Johnston County, the second-largest county in the reconfigured district, was enough for him to win.\n\nThe redrawn 7th is much more conservative and Republican than its predecessor.

After the recount, Rouzer conceded the race to McIntyre on November 28.  It was the closest House race in the country. [[Mitt Romney]] carried the district with 56 percent of the vote.\n\n==2014 congressional election==\nRouzer ran for the 7th district again in 2014. McIntyre retired rather than face a rematch.  Most pundits believed that with McIntyre's retirement, the seat would be an easy GOP pickup.  Even before his near-miss in 2012, the 7th had been trending Republican for some time.\n\nRouzer won the general election with almost 60% of the vote.  Upon taking office in January 2015, he became only the second Republican to represent a significant portion of eastern North Carolina in the House since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.rouzer.house.gov Congressman David Rouzer] official House website\n* [http://www.davidrouzer.com/ David Rouzer for Congress]\n* {{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/North_Carolina/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/David_Rouzer_%5BR-7%5D}}\n* {{C-SPAN|davidrouzer02}}\n* {{CongLinks | congbio=R000603 | votesmart=102964 | fec=H2NC07096 | congress=david-rouzer/2256 }}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-par|us-hs}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox\n| before = [[Mike McIntyre]]\n| start=January 3, 2015\n| state=North Carolina\n| district=7}}\n{{s-prec|usa}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Kathleen Rice]] <br>D-[[New York (state)|New York]] }}\n{{s-ttl|title=''[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]''|years=351st}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Steve Russell (politician)|Steve Russell]]<br>R-[[Oklahoma]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{NC-FedRep}}\n{{USHouseCurrent}}\n{{USCongRep-start|congresses= 114th\u2013115th [[United States Congress]]es |state=[[United States congressional delegations from North Carolina|North Carolina]]}}\n{{USCongRep/NC/114}}\n{{USCongRep/NC/115}}\n{{USCongRep-end}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rouzer, David}}\n[[Category:North Carolina state senators]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Durham, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:North Carolina State University alumni]]\n[[Category:North Carolina Republicans]]\n[[Category:1972 births]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:21st-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:People from Johnston County, North Carolina]]"}]}}}}
