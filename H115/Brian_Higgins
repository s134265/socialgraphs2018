(United States)|Republican]] who had represented the heavily Democratic 27th since 1993, unexpectedly announced his retirement in 2004. In April 2004, Higgins entered the race, and narrowly defeated then-[[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] [[Comptroller]] [[Nancy Naples]]. Even after redistricting following the 2000 census, the district was made slightly friendlier for Quinn (in part, by adding mostly rural Chautauqua County), but was still at the time the most Democratic district in the country to be represented by a Republican. The district has since reverted to form, and Higgins has been reelected three times without serious difficulty, never dropping below 60 percent of the vote. He easily dispatched his 2008 and 2010 opponents even after they posted six-figure fundraising numbers.<ref>[ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/2010/pas210.zip Contributions to candidates and other expenditures from committees, 2010], ''Federal Election Commission'', Washington, DC, 2010, Retrieved 23 March 2014.</ref><ref>[ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/2008/pas208.zip Contributions to candidates and other expenditures from committees, 2008], ''Federal Election Commission'', Washington, DC, 2008, Retrieved 23 March 2014.</ref> In both 2006 and 2008, Higgins garnered more than 70% of the vote.\n\nFor his first four terms, Higgins represented the southern two-thirds of Buffalo, as well as [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]]. Higgins' district was drawn by the federal special master to be much more compact and Democratic in the 2012 redistricting. He picked up all of Buffalo, as well as several inner-ring suburbs that used to be in the territory of [[Louise Slaughter]], and returning Chautauqua County to its traditional [[Southern Tier]] district. He also picked up a large slice of [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], including all of [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]] and all but a handful of residents in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].\n\nHiggins has received financial contributions for his campaigns from many business executives in Western New York throughout his tenure in Congress.<ref name=\"Funds\">Brian Higgins for congress, ''FindTheBest'', Summerland, CA: FindTheBest, 2014.</ref> In 2012, Higgins' re-election committee raised more than $1,000,000, with approximately 2/3 of that amount coming from individual donors, representing major businesses in Western New York.<ref name=\"Funds\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nHiggins resides in [[South Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|South Buffalo]].<ref name=\"Bio\"/> He has two adult children, Maeve and John.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[http://higgins.house.gov/ Congressman Brian Higgins] official U.S. House site\n*[http://www.higginsforcongress.com/ Brian Higgins for Congress]\n*{{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/New_York/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Brian_Higgins_%5BD-26%5D}}\n* {{CongLinks | congbio=H001038 | votesmart=23127 | fec=H4NY27076 | congress=brian-higgins/1794 }}\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-ny-hs}}\n{{succession box|title=[[New York State Assembly|New York State Assembly, 145th District]]|before=[[Richard J.
