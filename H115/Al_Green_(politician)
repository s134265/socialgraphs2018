The district includes most of southwestern [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], including most of that city's share of [[Fort Bend County]]. It also includes most of [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]]. Green is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n==Early life and early career==\nGreen was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He attended [[Florida A&M University]] and transferred to [[Tuskegee University]]. He subsequently attended the [[Thurgood Marshall School of Law]] at [[Texas Southern University]], where he received a [[Juris Doctor]] degree, in 1974. After being admitted to the [[State Bar of Texas|Texas Bar]], he remained in [[Houston]] and currently lives in the [[Alief, Houston|Alief]] community.\n\nIn 1978, Green was elected [[Justice of the Peace#Texas|justice of the peace]] in [[Harris County, Texas]], in the precinct 7, place 2 position. He held this position for 26 years.\n\nA former trial lawyer, Green co-founded the firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. He also served as president of the [[Houston]] [[NAACP]] and, during his term as the organization's leader, membership increased sevenfold. While serving as NAACP leader, he focused on increasing minority hiring in [[Texas]] and forming alliances with Hispanic groups.\n\nWhile still serving as a justice of the peace, Green ran for [[List of mayors of Houston|mayor of Houston]] in 1981, finishing fifth in the primary.\n\nGreen is a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite press release|title=U.S. Senate approves resolution |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity |date=November 6, 2006 |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/PressNewsDetails.php?newsID=25&newsCat=Press+Release |accessdate=December 31, 2008 |quote=Alpha Phi Alpha is an exceptional organization that deserves to be recognized and honored for all of its many great achievements. The fraternity has helped shape more than 175,000 young men into extraordinary leaders who contribute positively to their communities and the world. |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n=== Elections ===\n{{BLP sources section|date=May 2017}}\nIn 2004, Green entered the Democratic primary for the 9th District. The district had previously been the 25th, represented by Democrat [[Chris Bell (politician)|Chris Bell]]. However, Bell was placed in significant jeopardy as a result of the [[2003 Texas redistricting]]. Although the district was heavily Democratic, it had a significantly larger number of blacks and Latinos than its predecessor. The old 25th had been 65 percent white, while the new 9th was 17 percent white, 37 percent black and 33 percent Latino.  This left Bell vulnerable to a primary challenge from a black or Latino Democrat, and prompted him to file an ethics challenge against [[Tom DeLay]].\n\nIn the March 9 primary, Green beat Bell with 66 percent of the vote to Bell's 31 percent. He beat the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee Annette Molina in November.\n\nHe was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced only a Libertarian in 2008.  This is not surprising given this district's political tilt; with a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+29, it is the most Democratic district in Houston. [[Hillary Clinton]] carried it in 2016 with 79.3 percent of the vote, her strongest showing in Texas.\n\n=== Tenure ===\nWhile in Congress, Green has focused on issues similar to those that he worked for while with the NAACP. Fair housing and hiring practices for the poor and minorities are some of his greatest concerns.\n\nAfter the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]], in which he was once again reelected in Texas' 9th district,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/49680#.UKrASo7R30c|title=Al Green's Political Summary - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref> Green spoke at a press conference in Houston.
