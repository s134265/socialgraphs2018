The 2nd District, which had long been represented by Democrat [[Mo Udall]], was renumbered as the 7th District. [[Ed Pastor]], a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] Democrat who had succeeded Udall in 1991, had his home drawn into the newly created 4th District and opted to run for election there, making the 7th District an [[open seat]]. Grijalva won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, which was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. Before the 2010 election, he was reelected three times with no substantial [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition. In 2008, he defeated Republican challenger Joseph Sweeney.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Grijalva endorsed [[Barack Obama]] for President; his district, however, was won by [[Hillary Clinton]].\n\nDuring the 2010 midterms, Grijalva faced his toughest re-election campaign yet, against Republican Ruth McClung. It was reported that although Grijalva had decades of experience and McClung had none, and although there were twice as many Democrats in the district as there were Republicans, the two candidates were neck-and-neck in the polls. The main reason was Grijalva's call for a boycott of Arizona in response to the state's new immigration law, SB 1070. Grijalva won 50%-44% -- his closest margin of victory since being elected, and the first close election in what is now the 7th since 1978, when Udall was held to only 52 percent of the vote.\n\nGrijalva's district was renumbered as the 3rd District after the 2010 census, and made somewhat more Democratic than its predecessor even though it lost some of its share of Tucson to the 2nd District (the reconfigured 8th). Co-chair of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], Grijalva broke from many of his colleagues and announced his support for Democratic presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] on 9 October 2015 at a rally for Sanders in Tucson, Arizona.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bernie Sanders Gets First Congressional Endorsement, From Ra\u00fal Grijalva|url = https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/07/bernie-sanders-gets-first-congressional-endorsement-from-ral-grijalva/|website = The New York Times - First Draft|date = 2015-10-07|accessdate = 2015-10-09|first = Alan|last = Rappeport}}</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Arizona's 7th Congressional District Democratic Primary Election, 2002\n|-\n|'''Party'''\n|'''Candidate'''\n|'''Votes'''\n|'''%'''\n|-\n|Democratic\n|'''Ra\u00fal M.
