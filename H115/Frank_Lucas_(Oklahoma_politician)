Lucas is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OK|3}}, serving since 2003, having previously represented the 6th district, from 1994 to 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and chairs the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Committee on Agriculture]]. His district, numbered as the 6th district from 1994 to 2003, is the largest congressional district in the state and one of the largest in the nation that does not cover an entire state. It covers 34,088.49 square miles and stretches from the [[Oklahoma Panhandle|Panhandle]] to the fringes of the [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] suburbs\u2014almost half of the state's land mass.\n\n==United States House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Committee on Agriculture]]'''\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]]'''\n** [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises|Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises]]\n** [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology|Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology]]\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space and Technology]]'''\n** [[United States House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics|Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics]]\n** [[United States House Science Subcommittee on Energy and Environment|Subcommittee on Energy and Environment]]\n\n===Caucus memberships===\n* [[Congressional Western Caucus]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Members|author=|url=https://westerncaucus.house.gov/about/membership.htm|format=|publisher=Congressional Western Caucus|date=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref> \n\n===Legislation===\nOn April 7, 2014, Lucas introduced the [[Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress)]] into the House.<ref name=4413allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4413 \u2013 All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4413/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref> The bill would [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] through 2018 and amend some provisions of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].<ref name=DTCCnews>{{cite web|last1=Pagliocca|first1=Theresa|title=Customer Protection and End-User Relief Act (H.R. 4413) Receives House Committee Approval|url=http://www.dtcc.com/news/2014/april/14/customer-protection-and-end-user-relief-act.aspx|publisher=DTCC|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=14 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=cbo4413>{{cite web|title=CBO \u2013 H.R. 4413|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45381|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=19 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2012}}\n[[Image:Frank Lucas2.jpg|thumb|right|Oklahoma Congressman Frank Lucas speaks at a town hall meeting held in the Pioneer Technology Center in Ponca City, Oklahoma on September 26, 2011.]]\n\n===Oklahoma House of Representatives===\nHe first ran for the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]] in 1984 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] against the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], narrowly losing. A second attempt in 1986 also fell short, but he won in 1988.  He lost in 1990 after the legislature made his district somewhat friendlier to Democrats.  However, he returned in 1992.\n\n===U. S. House of Representatives===\n\nIn 1994, 6th district Congressman [[Glenn English]] stepped down to become a [[lobbyist]] for [[rural electric cooperative]]s. Lucas won the Republican nomination for the special election on May 10. He faced Dan Webber, [[press secretary]] to former [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[David L. Boren]], former president of the [[University of Oklahoma]]. The 6th was already by far the largest in the state, stretching from the Panhandle to the town of [[Spencer, Oklahoma|Spencer]], in the far northeastern [[Oklahoma City]] metropolitan area. However, the state legislature had redrawn it so that it included many poor Oklahoma City neighborhoods that had never voted Republican. Lucas scored a major upset; he won by eight percentage points, carrying 18 of the district's 24 [[County (United States)|counties]]. His victory has been seen by some pundits as an early sign of the wave six months later that saw the Republicans take control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Lucas himself won a full term in that wave with 70 percent of the vote. He has been re-elected seven times, never dropping below 59 percent of the vote, and even ran unopposed in 2002 and 2004.\n\nLucas' district was renumbered as the 3rd after Oklahoma lost a district in the 2000 Census. His already vast district was made even larger. He lost most of his share of Oklahoma City, which was home to 60 percent of the district's population. He once represented much of the downtown area, including the site of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]]. He still represents that portion of the city located in [[Canadian County, Oklahoma|Canadian County]].  To make up for this large population loss, the 3rd was pushed further to the east, picking up the western portion of the Tulsa metro area (including a small portion of Tulsa itself) and some rural areas. As a result, his district now includes 48.5 percent of the state's landmass, and is nearly as large as the state's other four districts combined.\n\n===2014 Republican primary===\nIn the 2014 Republican primary, Lucas won 83% of the vote. 12% went to Robert Hubbard; and 5% went to Timothy Ray Murray.<ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2014/by_state/OK_US_House_0624.html?SITE=AP&SECTION=POLITICS  \"Oklahoma \u2013 Summary Vote Results June 25, 2014 \u2013 05:28PM ET\" ''Associated Press'']</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ {{ushr|Oklahoma|6|}}: Results 1992\u20132000<ref name=\"clerkresults\">{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |title=Election Statistics |accessdate=2008-01-10 |publisher=Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070725184700/http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |archivedate=2007-07-25 |df= }}</ref>\n!|Year\n!\n!|Democrat\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|Republican\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|3rd Party\n!|Party\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n|-\n|[[U.S. House election, 1992|1992]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |{{nowrap|'''[[Glenn English]]'''}} *\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} align=\"right\" |134,734\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |68%\n|\n|{{Party shading/Republican}} |[[Bob Anthony]]\n|{{Party shading/Republican}} align=\"right\" |64,068\n|{{Party shading/Republican}} |32%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[U.S. House election, 1994|1994]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |{{nowrap|Jeffrey S.
