He was named to this committee because his district is home to the [[National Security Agency]]. From January 3, 2011 to January 3, 2015, he served as this committee's ranking Democrat. The position placed Ruppersberger on the elite \"Gang of Eight\", which refers to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader, House speaker and House minority leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country's most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.\n\n===Shock trauma===\nRuppersberger decided to run for office after a near-fatal car accident while investigating a drug trafficking case.

The [[Maryland General Assembly]] significantly altered the 2nd by shifting most of its share of Harford County to the 1st and 6th Districts. In its place, the legislature added a heavily Democratic portion of Baltimore City that had previously been in the 1st District. This turned the 2nd from a swing district into a strongly Democratic district.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAn August 2011 editorial by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the 2nd district as \"curlicue territories strung together by impossibly delicate tendrils of land\" and \"a crazy-quilt confection drawn for the express purpose of ousting the incumbent at the time, Rep.
